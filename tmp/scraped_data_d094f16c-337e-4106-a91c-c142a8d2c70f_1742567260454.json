Here's what we found. In today's world of powerful generative AI tools, having a top-tier AI video generator in your metaphorical back pocket is like having your own personal Hollywood film crew at your service. In fact, AI video generators are now so capable that major brands are switching from old video production methods to these modern AI-powered ones. Even the Tribeca Film Festival and other players in the film industry are jumping aboard the AI movement, highlighting just how dynamic and impressive these tools are becoming. But if you're reading this and think it sounds like AI video generators are just for the creative pros, don't worry because that's not the case. With AI text-to-video, AI-generated avatars, and tons of other awesome new AI video features, literally anyone can create unbelievably high-quality content. I made this anime trailer, and I think it‚Äôs pretty cool. The pictures, animation, and even the song were all generated by AI. Let me break down the process and tell you how it was done üëá pic.twitter.com/Y117zidiei ‚Äî Framer üá±üáπ (@0xFramer) August 22, 2024 But with so many options flooding the market, it can be tough to figure out which tool is the right fit for you. Each promises to be the best, but how do you know which will deliver on that promise and actually be the best AI video generator? We made this guide to help you navigate the crowded field and find the tool that suits your needs. We've carefully selected and reviewed seven top contenders, focusing on what they offer, where they excel, and where they might fall short. So, if you've ever wondered, \"What is the best AI video generator?\" you're in the right place. What is an AI video generator? In the simplest of terms, an AI video generator is a tool that uses artificial intelligence to automate the video creation process. Instead of manually editing clips, adding effects, and syncing audio, these tools handle the heavy lifting for you. You just input text, images, or other media, and AI turns that into a complete video through text to video generation. By using AI, these tools automatically select the best visuals, create smooth transitions, and even generate voiceovers with realistic AI avatars. This means you can focus more on crafting your message and less on getting bogged down in the technical details. How do AI video generators work? AI video generators work by using advanced algorithms to analyze and process your input, whether it‚Äôs text, images, or other media. When you provide the content, the AI interprets it and makes decisions about how to structure the video. This includes selecting visuals, syncing audio, and applying effects‚Äîall in a matter of minutes. ‚ú® From Photo AI image to video with @LumaLabsAI's video model that came out today called Dream Machine It's absolutely state of the art and the best video model available right now I think It's able to highly accurately predict 3d surroundings from just a photo, I think up‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/KDetDBdGIS ‚Äî @levelsio (@levelsio) June 13, 2024 At the core of these tools is machine learning, which allows the AI to improve over time. The more data it processes, the better it becomes at making creative decisions that result in high-quality videos. For example, if you input a script, the AI video tool can generate corresponding scenes, choose relevant images or video clips, and even create a voiceover. The process is surprisingly intuitive. You simply provide the material, and the AI organizes it into a cohesive video that aligns with your vision. How we chose the best AI video generators To ensure you pick the best AI video generators and generative AI editing tools, we chose products that truly deliver on their promises of creating amazing videos. No matter how skilled you are at video editing, you need an AI tool that simplifies the process. Next, we evaluated the range of features. A great AI video maker should offer more than just basic editing‚Äîit should allow you to customize and tweak your video clips until they look like they were made by a professional film crew. We also compared the pricing plans, ensuring that they offer a solid mix of features without breaking the bank. Our goal was to find tools that help you save time and money. ‚Äç 1. AI Studios by Deepbrain AI DeepBrain AI‚Äôs video generator is a robust all-in-one tool that brings realistic AI avatars, natural text-to-speech, and intuitive video creation into one seamless platform. Whether you‚Äôre making educational videos, marketing content, or AI-powered presentations, it streamlines the entire process with easy-to-use tools and customizable features.

You can pair these avatars with lifelike AI voices, customize their look, and even use templates to get a head start. Tools like script generation, voice cloning, and text-to-speech make content creation feel effortless, even if you‚Äôre not a video editing pro. Why we like AI Studios by Deepbrain AI: New and powerful For teams, DeepBrain AI shines with collaborative features that let you sync up in a shared workspace. Add to that the ability to export videos in multiple formats, and you‚Äôve got a powerful tool for turning ideas into polished videos ‚Äì fast. Whether you're experimenting with the free plan or scaling up with Team and Enterprise options, the flexibility here ensures there‚Äôs something for everyone. Where AI Studios could improve We love the power and usability of this tool, but since they are relatively new to the space, they could benefit from more brand recognition. Once more people are familiar with this tool and how it can help with creative workflow, we are confident it will be a go-to product for designers and creatives of all stripes. Pricing options: Free plan ($0.00) Personal ($24.00/month) Team ($55.00/month) Enterprise (Custom) 2. Luma Dream Machine Dream Machine by Luma Labs is a video creation tool that uses AI to generate extremely lifelike videos. You can quickly turn your images or text prompts into professional-looking clips. The process of creating a video takes just a couple of minutes. Each video is about five seconds long and can include multiple shots, making them richer and more detailed than many competitors‚Äô outputs. During my tests, some videos were ready quickly, while others took longer, but all captured motion better than any other tool I‚Äôve tried. Whether you're crafting an epic scene or a visually intense moment, Dream Machine captures the essence of storytelling with visuals that feel straight out of Hollywood. Created product mockup videos with Luma Dream Machine V1.5 text-to-video model, and I‚Äôm really happy with the results. You can find the prompts in the thread, and you can use the same ones with Midjourney or Flux.#LumaDreamMachine pic.twitter.com/VISWZK8TEp ‚Äî Gizem Akdag (@gizakdag) August 21, 2024 Why we like Dream Machine: Most cinematic If you're a creator with a flair for the cinematic, you're going to love making videos with Dream Machine. What really stands out is that you don't need precise details for motion areas, Dream Machine still manages to capture motion concepts effectively. Itfollows the laws of physics, ensuring that every shot feels grounded and realistic. Plus, it‚Äôs super fast! As their website mentions, Dream Machine can currently produce 120 frames in 120 seconds, which is not too shabby to say the least. Where Dream Machine could improve Although Dream Machine is generally fast, some users have experienced slower processing times when working on intricate projects with a lot of elements. The discard rate can be around 98% with Reddit users pointing that most of the videos generated are unusable because of random elements, incorrect motion, or distortion. Pricing options: Free Plan ($0.00) Lite Plan ($7.99/month) Standard Plan ($23.99/month) Plus Plan ($51.99/month) Pro Plan ($79.99/month) 3. Runway Gen-3 Alpha Runway calls their latest model, Gen-3 Alpha, the new frontier for video generation, and we are here to say that they could definitely be right. The Gen-3 Alpha supports text to video, image to video, advanced camera control, multi motion brush, and after testing some of these features out, we were seriously impressed by how smooth and sharp the results are. The video creation workflow feels super streamlined, thanks to the improved fidelity and motion‚Äîit‚Äôs clear this model was built for powerful things. Add expressiveness and intention to your generations with Multi Motion Brush. Learn how with today's Runway Academy: https://t.co/EUbxc4aA0D pic.twitter.com/qredD7vsXu ‚Äî Runway (@runwayml) January 23, 2024 Why we like Runway: Most dynamic Runway's Gen-3 Alpha is one of the most impressive AI video generators we‚Äôve come across. Not only is it a powerful tool for video that makes content creation seem limitless, but it has a shockingly friendly interface and is easy to use. With the Multi Motion Brush, you can select up to five areas with independent motion and control across 3 directional axis (x, y, z) for more precise and expressive generations. Another highlight is how well it handles human-like characters. The AI generates lifelike figures with natural expressions and gestures, adding a level of realism that‚Äôs hard to beat. We aren't exaggerating when we say you'll likely be blown away by what you generate with this tool. The videos are truly cinematic and offer an exciting glimpse into the future of creativity. Where Runway could improve Runway is an extraordinary tool, so it is hard to say where it can improve. Of course, with such a dynamic AI video generator comes cost, which might be the only thing holding back casual users or if you're on a budget. Plus, it is true that sometimes the final results might look a little \"wonky,\" but overall the quality is top-tier. Pricing options: Basic Plan ($0 per editor per month) Standard Plan ($12 per user per month, billed annually as $144) Pro Plan ($28 per user per month, billed annually as $336) Unlimited Plan ($76 per user per month, billed annually as $912) Enterprise Plan (Customized with Runway team) 4. Hailuo AI Hailuo AI is an AI-powered video generator designed to make content creation simple but still extraordinary. Whether you‚Äôre making cinematic videos for marketing, detailedproduct explainers, or social media ads, this tool automates the heavy lifting‚Äîgiving you professional-looking results in minutes. Instead of spending hours fine-tuning every frame, creators can focus on storytelling while the AI ensures smooth motion, clean edits, and stunning visuals. #Hailuo AI is absolutely insane for creating Hollywood-style blockbuster scenes! üé¨üî• Every test is a thrill pic.twitter.com/idaAJWb2BZ ‚Äî Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) March 6, 2025 Why we like Hailuo AI: Fast yet eye-popping For businesses and content creators who need speed, flexibility, and truly remarkable videos, Hailuo AI delivers. One of the standout features is its customizable templates, which allow users to tweak layouts, colors, and visual styles without advanced editing skills. So regardless of what kind of content you ar making, whether it's onboarding video or a marketing campaign, Hailuo AI makes sure your content looks tailored, not cookie-cutter. Where Hailuo AI Could Improve While the AI does a great job with automation, some users may find the customization options a bit limited. For example, while templates are helpful, they don‚Äôt always allow for fine-grained control over pacing and scene composition. Additionally, industries needing highly specific branding‚Äîlike film production or high-end advertising‚Äîmight need more flexibility in motion effects and camera angles. Pricing options: Standard plan ($14.90 per month) Unlimited plan ($94.90 per month) 5. Kling AI The Kling AI video generator produces highly realistic 1080p videos up to two minutes long, all from a single prompt. The key difference? It doesn‚Äôt just generate good-looking footage‚Äîit ensures movements and physics behave naturally, making everything feel more lifelike. Have an Amazing Day!‚òÄÔ∏èüôÇ‚òïÔ∏è Name: Flower Care Made with @Kling_ai 1.6 Text to Video#AIart Good Monday #MondayMotivation #Mondayvibes pic.twitter.com/MEvNj9HVrw ‚Äî Jay Kay (@JayKay65220066) March 10, 2025 Why we like Kling AI: Smooth, natural motion What sets Kling apart is how well it captures human motion and expression. Thanks to its 3D face and body reconstruction technology, characters move fluidly and show natural emotions‚Äîall from a single image. Its physics engine also shines, allowing for believable object interactions and environments that behave like real-world scenes. Whether you're creating short films, virtual influencers, or AI-generated marketing content, Kling delivers a level of realism that‚Äôs hard to match. Where Kling AI could improve While Kling is impressive, it‚Äôs not perfect. Some users report slow processing times, especially for highly detailed scenes. Occasionally, minor inconsistencies appear, like hand distortions or subtle motion glitches. More control over camera angles and fine-tuning details would make it even stronger for professional creators. Pricing options: Basic (free) Standard ($72.90 yearly) Pro ($293.04 yearly) Premier ($728.64 yearly) 6. revid AI This tool might be new on the scene, but for improving video productivity for socials, revid is quickly becoming one of our favorites. Their mission is all about helping creators like you make short videos that have a potential to go viral. Why we like revid AI: Best for social media What we like most about revid AI is that it has a specific focus. The AI does the heavy lifting from finding ideas, adding sound effects, creating scripts, and then transforming everything into viral videos for your social media content. It‚Äôs a company that knows its lane, and we can certainly appreciate its dedication to being the master of one instead of the jack of all AI video trades. Where revid AI could improve The main drawback with revid AI is that it is niche. This is fine if you need this specific type of content, but it may be lacking if you're searching for a more powerful tool. Pricing options Hobby ($49/month) Growth (Launch offer $49/month) Ultra ($199/month) 7. Colossyan Whether you're making screen recordings for employee training, video marketing content for social media platforms, or educational videos for compliance training, Colossyan offers features that simplify video making for established businesses. Why we like Colossyan: Best for large businesses Colossyan is awesome with AI video editing, offering tools like prompt to video and AI script assistants that help you create excellent videos without needing tons of experience. While it is definitely on the more corporate side of video creation, we saw this tool streamline the creation process and make it easy to produce high-quality generated videos super fast and efficiently. Plus, Colossyan‚Äôs extensive library of AI avatars and multilingual support make it a nice choice for large companies and diverse clients. Where Colossyan could improve While Colossyan has a ton of cool features, it may require a bit of a learning curve for those new to AI video tools. The sheer number of options, from AI avatars to multiple export formats, can be overwhelming for beginners. Pricing options Starter Plan ($19/month, annually) Pro Plan ($61/month, billed annually) Enterprise Plan (Custom Pricing) 8. HeyGen HeyGen is one of the more impressive platforms we tested. A big reason for this is because it is hassle-free and easy to use, so jumping in was a simple process. More specifically, HeyGen is one of the best when it comes to generating AI avatars. The process of creating a HeyGen avatar boils down to three steps: choosing or creating an avatar, recording or choosing a voice to go with it, selecting a video template, then letting HeyGen put it all together in a matter of minutes. Why we like HeyGen: Most intriguing video generator One of the coolest features of HeyGen is its AI avatars, which are constantly evolving. The platform frequently updates these avatars to include enhanced visual details, expanded speech abilities, and more lifelike animations. Another great feature is the change videos to multiple langauges. HeyGen allows you to create videos in over forty languages from your original video, letting you reach audiences from all parts of the world. Where HeyGen could improve While HeyGen offers a lot of flexibility, the pricing for the Team plan might be higher for smaller teams or individual creators. Additionally, the Free plan, although great for beginners, limits users to just 3 videos per month, which may not be enough for those who need to produce content regularly. Pricing options Free Plan ($0) Creator Plan ($24/mo) Team Plan ($69/seat/mo) Enterprise Plan (Custom Pricing) 9. Haiper AI After diving into Haiper AI, we quickly realized it‚Äôs a promising tool for anyone looking to explore the world of AI-driven video creation. One of the first things that stood out to us is how Haiper AI makes the video creation process both accessible and efficient, even for those just starting. With just 3 images, @escelce transported us through 3 different universes, holy cow! #KeyframeConditioning #AIvideo #MadeWithHaiper https://t.co/6FwlLObhIK pic.twitter.com/JZdJOq3QMb ‚Äî Haiper AI (@HaiperGenAI) August 19, 2024 Why we like Haiper AI: Best for beginners What we appreciated most about Haiper AI is its flexibility and how user friendly it was. The platform allows for up to 10 creations per day on the Free plan, which is generous for a no-cost option. That, on top of the text-to-speech feature helps make Haiper a solid tool. For those who need more, the Explorer and Pro plans offer expanded features that cater to different levels of use. Where Haiper AI could improve One of the primary limitations is that the Free plan doesn‚Äôt allow for commercial use or watermark-free videos. This might be a dealbreaker for users who need to produce content for business purposes but aren‚Äôt ready to invest in a paid plan. Pricing options Free Plan (Beta, $0/month): Explorer Plan (Beta, $8/month, billed yearly) Pro Plan (Beta, $24/month, billed yearly) Enterprise APIs (Custom Pricing) ‚Äç 10. Synthesia Synthesia is a game-changer for simplifying the process of making (sometimes scarily) realistic AI avatars. With simple text-based prompts, Synthesia turns your script into a polished, video ready project featuring life-like avatars. Why we like Synthesia: Excellent for avatars Even if you're new to video Synthesia has an intuitive interface that makes creating and editing your video feel straightforward. You simply choose an avatar, input your text prompts, and watch as the AI works its magic, transforming your words into engaging content. Plus, the AI video editor allows you to tweak and refine your video, so you can take the time to make those small changes that really make your vision come to life. So whether it is explainer videos, content creation for blog posts, or other marketing projects, Synthesia is excellent for businesses who want to make videos for their products or services. Where Synthesia could improve One of the main limitations is the degree of control available for the AI avatars. The avatars do look polished, but the options for appearance and expressions are somewhat limited compared to more advanced tools. Pricing Options Free Plan (‚Ç¨0/mo) Starter Plan (‚Ç¨20/mo) Creator Plan (‚Ç¨59/mo) Enterprise Plan (custom pricing) ‚Äç ‚Äç Wrapping up: The future of AI Video Tools AI in video and avatar creation has come a long way. From quirky results to making videos you‚Äôd swear were real, AI's gotten pretty good at this stuff. But the trick isn‚Äôt just making videos look real‚Äîit‚Äôs about getting them to move right, too. With tools like Luma Labs‚Äô Dream Machine or Synthesia, we see how far AI can go in understanding motion and realistic avatars. These advancements are opening doors to new ways to create and tell stories, and brands like Mcdonald's Japan aren't afraid to test it out. These tools aren't here to replace humans in the creative process; but to make it possible to do more, to be even more innovative, without needing blockbuster budgets. Thanks to AI, we‚Äôre moving toward a future where anyone can produce a mini-movie or use avatars for product demos. It‚Äôs exciting to think about how these tools will help us all be more creative and bring our wildest ideas to life. So, go ahead and play around with these AI video generators.

Adobe Premiere Pro | Best AI Software to Create Videos Pros Best all round video editor Cloud-syncing for backups Free trial available Colour matching speeds up edits Auto reframing useful for social media Cons Subscription based model Steep learning curve Requires high computer specs download Not only is Premiere Pro my pick of the best video editing software, but it‚Äôs now my favourite AI video app too. With the latest version you can download using the button above, you‚Äôll get some crazy powerful AI tools to make creating high quality videos a cinch. Colour Match allows you to match the colours in two different clips in your sequence to help get rid of any discrepancies between different shots in the same scene ‚Äì really useful if you use two different cameras. The Auto Reframe tool is a godsend for social media video content, allowing you to change horizontal 16:9 video footage into a tall 9:16 aspec ratio, perfect for instagram Stories or YouTube Shorts. If you shoot interviews, the auto audio ducking feature uses AI to lower the volume of music when dialogue is happening Adobe Sensei is the ‚Äòbrain‚Äô behind the AI in Premiere Pro, providing other features such as Auto Classification which tags your footage and Morph Cut which smoothes out jump cuts. Overall, even if you didn‚Äôt use any of the AI video features in Premiere Pro, you‚Äôd still be left with the top editing software of the year ‚Äì start by downloading a free trial and see what you think. How to Download Adobe Premiere Pro 2. Topaz Video AI | Photography AI Tool for Enlargements Pros Extremely powerful video editing tool Free trial available Upscaling, image stabilization, and slow-motion capabilities Can generate multiple previews at the same time Cons Relatively expensive download Simply put, Topaz Video AI is a standalone desktop video editing application that makes your videos look better. Drag and drop your video into the software, select from the menu of presets, and let the deep-learning robot minds cast their magic. You can even upscale your footage. That means that all your grainy, blurry old 1080p film can now be enhanced to 4K or 8K. You can also render your footage in slow motion which can be handy if you forgot to shoot in the correct frame rate: Let‚Äôs say you shot at 24 fps ‚Äì give Topaz that video and the AI will create new frames between the actual frames you shot, so your 24 fps could become 60 fps, and you can slow it right down. The program also has two types of image stabilization to help you produce engaging videos: The first crops into your footage to create this effect, and the other is image-aware and will fill in the missing gaps around the edges of your video so that the field of view doesn‚Äôt change. With this powerful AI video editing software, you can tweak just about any setting you‚Äôd want to use to enhance the quality of your footage ‚Äì the frame rate, the amount of grain, or the sharpness. Not only that, you can create your own custom presets for adding to future videos. Topaz Video AI Review 3. Filmora | Affordable AI Video Maker Pros Simple, easy-to-use interface Good suite of AI tools Subscription or perpetual license options Affordable Cons Doesn‚Äôt have the slick feel of some competitors download As well as giving you all the tools you‚Äôd expect from a video editing suite, for adding templates, titles and subtitles, and for making adjustments to the video and audio tracks, Filmora also has some fantastic AI tools. You can adjust your footage‚Äôs aspect ratio, upscale video resolution from lowly 1080p to, for example, 4K, and change your frame rate to make fast video slow and slow video fast. Other AI tools include their chroma key, which enables you to remove specific background colours. This is especially useful for green screen footage, to make the background transparent so that you can add other media. AI portrait does essentially the same thing and removes even complex backgrounds from behind subjects. Added to that, Filmora has AI image stabilization, and lens correction to help you sort out any irritating distortion your lens might have gifted you. In general, Filmora is my recommended video editing software for beginners ‚Äì it may not have every feature of Final Cut or Adobe Premiere for video creation, but for the price, it can‚Äôt be beaten. Filmora Review Best green screen software 4. Deep Brain | Text to Speech AI Video Tools Pros Innovative AI human technology Multi-language text-to-speech solutions Wide application across sectors Free online AI video editor Highly customizable avatars Cons Learning curve download DeepBrain AI stands out in the field of artificial intelligence with its cutting-edge AI human technology. It excels at creating real-time, interactive artificial humans that can be employed in various domains, such as customer service, virtual assistance, and educational content delivery. Their service enables the use of AI avatars that are customizable to suit different business needs, providing a unique interactive experience for end-users. It‚Äôs particularly beneficial for enterprises looking to scale their operations with AI while maintaining a human-like touch in their customer engagement strategies. 5. Fliki | Best AI Video Generator Pros Simple workflow to convert ideas, scripts, blogs, PPT, product URLs, and tweets into videos 2000+ AI voices in 75+ languages and 100+ dialects First in the industry to offer AI-generated video clips High-quality avatars with voice cloning in 29 languages Translate/Dub videos in 75+ Languages Intuitive and easy-to-use interface Cons Require a paid subscription for premium features download Fliki is a groundbreaking text to video AI tool perfect for transforming text into engaging videos with professional voiceovers. Its user-friendly design makes it accessible even to those with little technical experience, allowing them to produce high-quality video content effortlessly. Fliki‚Äôs extensive voice selection, available in 75+ languages and over 100 dialects, provides unparalleled personalization options. It also offers advanced voice cloning in 29 languages, and it leads the industry with its unique AI video clips‚Äîjust input text and watch as Fliki‚Äôs AI crafts distinct video content akin to OpenAI‚Äôs Sora technology. Whether you‚Äôre a content creator, a marketer, or just someone with a personal project, Fliki AI Video Generator provides the tools and flexibility needed to produce visually appealing and impactful videos. 6. Veed.io Pros Good for beginners Easy to learn Range of templates and tools Speech to subtitles feature Cons Some features are only available in higher price plans download One of the best AI video editing options for beginners is Veed.io. It has an extremely simple and easy-to-learn interface, but despite this, it still packs a punch. Veed.io has many of the features of the previous two video editing software programs in this article. With it, you can change the frame rate to speed up or slow down your footage, and you can also remove backgrounds with a single click. Something it‚Äôs well-known for is its AI-powered speech to subtitles tool, which accurately transcribes in moments, saving you potential hours of work. And there‚Äôs also the text-to-speech feature. With this, you can give your video a voiceover without manually recording your own voice, and you can choose from a range of voice profiles and accents. I‚Äôve included Veed in this list of the best AI video software because I‚Äôve spent many a day transcribing videos manually, and know how frustrating it can be. What is an AI camera? 7. Synthesia Pros Easy way to make presentations Powerful, simple-to-use tool Impressive range of features Affordable AI video creation platform Cons Limited, specialized use case download Synthesia specializes in speech-to-video creation using artificial intelligence to create engaging videos. They give you a range of templates and amazingly lifelike avatars which you can make say anything you want ‚Äì ideal for creating YouTube videos you don‚Äôt want to appear in. Whatever you type, they can say in a range of accents, using diction and, in the most recent iteration, gestures. It‚Äôs spooky how realistic it all sounds ‚Äì even if you don‚Äôt have any staff or any desire to appear in YouTube videos yourself, Synthesia can help with your video creation. You can add a background behind your avatar, add a music track, and use a range of other tools to make the video your own. How can AI benefit photography? 8. InVideo Pros Easy to use and learn Simple but powerful Simple, two-tier pricing Article-to-text feature Cons Only the highest membership tiers have access to the best video and image libraries download This software shares a lot in look and feel with Veed.io. It has a super-simple, clean interface that is very easy to navigate. It also has a vast bank of templates for a range of needs from sports to marketing, to help you kick things off. One of its most impressive features is the AI-powered article-to-text tool. With this, you can copy and paste an article into the tool, and it will scrape the text to extract the main ideas, and then create concise content around these. It can create a unique video from an article too. Let‚Äôs say I wanted to make a video from this article ‚Äì I could just paste the URL into InVid, and the video would be created for me! This makes it the best AI video tool for batch creating multiple clips from a blog. Like Veed.io, InVideo also offers automated text-to-speech. No more need to record voiceovers, all thanks to the power of video artificial intelligence. What‚Äôs the best mobile video editing app for iPhone and Android? 9. Descript Pros Unique product Powerful editing tools Edit video with text Slick interface Cons It‚Äôs not for everyone, but that‚Äôs just me trying to find something to say download One for the podcasters. A powerful speech-to-text editor that will save you time by allowing you to edit automatically transcribed text and video voiceover at the same time. Simply put, you can record yourself, your voice and your face, and Descript uses AI to make a video and a written script from this. You can then edit that script, for example shortening long pauses in your speech, removing filler and thinking words, or removing whole phrases. Whatever you remove is also removed from the recorded footage, thereby seamlessly editing your video with AI. The software also allows you to sync your visuals with specific moments in the script, and there‚Äôs a toolbar to help you collaborate on a project with a team. Add to that powerful video editing features such as the ability to grade colours, remove backgrounds, and beef up sound quality, and you have yourself a winner. 10. FlexClip Pros Interface good for beginners Great template and stock library AI speech to text AI text to speech Cons Limited tools for pros Only exports to 1080p download This software is rich in templates and has an impressive amount of stock imagery and video you can use to inspire or pad out your videos. The interface is very simple ‚Äì it‚Äôs the best AI video editing software I tested for beginners, who will get the hang of it very easily. Once you have your footage uploaded, you have the standard range of editing tools to work with, to make your video look exactly as you want it to. You can adjust the brightness, and the speed, you can flip it around, trim it, or use FlexClip‚Äôs range of filters to automatically adjust the colours. In terms of AI video creation features, there‚Äôs speech-to-text, which can quickly generate subtitles, and text-to-speech, which can help you make natural-sounding voiceovers. 11. Rawshorts Pros Good library of resources Timesaver for small businesses Text to animation Automatic voice generator Cons Free version is quite limited download This powerful tool is specifically for people who want to make video animations. Write a script (or get ChatGPT to do that for you!) and paste it into the program. The software will then generate a voiceover, scrape your text for the main ideas, and then use those to make a coherent, animated storyboard. You‚Äôve probably seen these types of animations used on software product sales pages to explain how to use the software. This type of animation can cost thousands of dollars to produce (not to mention countless hours of drawing), but now thanks to AI, you can do it for a fraction of the time and cost. If you need to create videos for small businesses, you can imagine how much easier this clever AI video tool can make your work. 12. Lumen 5 Pros Quick and easy tool to use Text to video Good range of editing tools Cons Free version is very limited download This nifty AI video editing softwa re software helps you automatically transform blog posts, Zoom calls, or articles, into video. It‚Äôs super easy to do. For example, just paste your blog article URL into the program, and it will extract the key points to match them with relevant text and video. From there, you can tweak what you want, edit text, and swap out photos and videos from Lumen 5‚Äôs online library. You can also make talking head videos and enhance your videos with callouts and cutaways. My favourite feature is the ability to select words in the transcript (auto-generated by AI, of course!), then match the visuals directly to the timing of the audio. For video creation for social media, which often needs captions timed to voice over or talking heads, this AI video app is insanely useful. 13. SyntheSys Pros Professional-level software Text-to-video capabilities Easy-to-use dashboard Cons More expensive than other text-to-video competitors download Using SyntheSys, you can get a lifelike avatar to present a video for you, generated from text, or create a natural-sounding voiceover track. They have a library of male and female avatars, and their technology allows them to use gestures, and natural voice tones, and speak in 145 languages. It‚Äôs a great tool for businesses, or anyone wanting to quickly create human-looking and -sounding content for commercial purposes. Whether you want to remain anonymous in your video clips or simply prefer to use someone else, AI video generators like this can help speed up your video creation process. What Is the Best AI Tool to Create Videos? It really depends on what kind of video you want to create, as there is quite a diverse range of AI video generators out there for different use cases. A cinematographer or videographer is more likely to need a tool with the power and scope of Topaz Video AI or Filmora. These can really help you dive deep into your footage and create something extraordinary for professional videos. Veed.io and InVid are best for beginners or those who perhaps need video clips for personal use or smaller scale production edits. Then there are the tools that are better for small businesses, YouTubers, or for commercial use. Descript is a great tool for Youtubers and podcasters to clean up their script and video, whereas Rawshorts will help you create an animation from your script. Those looking for AI to make them a voiceover or a complete presentation with a video or even an avatar will need something different again. Lumen 5, for example, will help you create high quality videos like these, while Synthesia or SyntheSys will generate a presentation for you with a human-ish presenter. How Does an AI Video Generator Work? The computer science behind the nuts and bolts of AI video generation is beyond both my human intelligence and the scope of this article. But in simple terms, what I understand of it is that machine-learning, the machine who has learned ‚Äì which is a way of saying ‚Äòan extremely powerful computer‚Äô ‚Äì knowing language on some robotic, mathematical level, scrapes the text and converts it into computer language: numbers. As computers understand everything in these terms, the combinations of numbers it receives from the text will correspond to number patterns within videos that express the same ideas as the text. They will match. And thus, a video is born. AI Video Editing Software FAQ s What is the best AI tool to create videos? For creating videos and ease of use, I‚Äôd have to say Lumen 5 for enabling you to quickly make a coherent video from text, or SyntheSys for creating realistic avatar-led video presentations. For specific edits, Topaz Video AI can‚Äôt be beaten. Is there an AI that edits videos? Yes. For example, Topaz AI and Filmora both help you edit your videos. You can use image stabilization, change the frame rate to create natural-looking slow-motion effects, upscale your videos, and do many more things that only a year or so ago, weren‚Äôt possible. How do I know if a video was created by AI? With many ai video editing tools, you simply won‚Äôt know, and that‚Äôs increasingly the case. The AI tools in Topaz Video AI are so powerful there‚Äôs really no way of telling if that slow-motion video was originally filmed at 60 fps or 24 fps. Likewise, the human avatar you can use to give your video presentations can use natural gestures, voice tones and intonation, which can make it very difficult to know if they‚Äôre real or not. Take for example, the Deep Fake video below: It‚Äôs certainly very hard to spot if the video creation was by AI or if it was actual footage. What AI video app is everyone using? Everyone is using all of them! All of the video apps in this article are being used by someone, somewhere to save time, to be more efficient, and to create something more compelling for a variety of use cases. If I had to choose one, I‚Äôd say it was Topaz Video AI, just because that‚Äôs the world I come from, and I know that it‚Äôs a very popular resource. For another use case, I‚Äôd find it hard to believe that most podcasters weren‚Äôt using Descript, as it‚Äôs such a powerful and powerfully specialised tool. Is Synthesia Ai video free to use? No, it‚Äôs not. Synthesia is only offered on a subscription basis. AI Video Editing Tools: Final Words So there you go. Honestly, even though I wrote this article myself, my mind is a little blown. AI is so new, but it can already do so much. It‚Äôs hard to know where it‚Äôs going to lead, but although that‚Äôs a little terrifying, it‚Äôs also exciting. Especially if you‚Äôre working with video. The AI video generators and tools available to you are so powerful that they will change the way you film and the way you think about filming. Cinematographers can make 8K cinematic, slow-motion, fully stabilized footage from 1080p footage filmed on an old camera. YouTubers can make video content of themselves with all their thinking words removed. Businesses can make promo videos, voiceovers or video presentations without hiring voiceover artists. It‚Äôs head-spinning! Doesn‚Äôt it make you want to create AI generated videos just to see how incredible the technology has become? If you‚Äôre not already using AI video generators in some form, it definitelt feels like right now is the time to start.

Veed.io Pros Good for beginners Easy to learn Range of templates and tools Speech to subtitles feature Cons Some features are only available in higher price plans download One of the best AI video editing options for beginners is Veed.io. It has an extremely simple and easy-to-learn interface, but despite this, it still packs a punch. Veed.io has many of the features of the previous two video editing software programs in this article. With it, you can change the frame rate to speed up or slow down your footage, and you can also remove backgrounds with a single click. Something it‚Äôs well-known for is its AI-powered speech to subtitles tool, which accurately transcribes in moments, saving you potential hours of work. And there‚Äôs also the text-to-speech feature. With this, you can give your video a voiceover without manually recording your own voice, and you can choose from a range of voice profiles and accents. I‚Äôve included Veed in this list of the best AI video software because I‚Äôve spent many a day transcribing videos manually, and know how frustrating it can be. What is an AI camera? 7. Synthesia Pros Easy way to make presentations Powerful, simple-to-use tool Impressive range of features Affordable AI video creation platform Cons Limited, specialized use case download Synthesia specializes in speech-to-video creation using artificial intelligence to create engaging videos. They give you a range of templates and amazingly lifelike avatars which you can make say anything you want ‚Äì ideal for creating YouTube videos you don‚Äôt want to appear in. Whatever you type, they can say in a range of accents, using diction and, in the most recent iteration, gestures. It‚Äôs spooky how realistic it all sounds ‚Äì even if you don‚Äôt have any staff or any desire to appear in YouTube videos yourself, Synthesia can help with your video creation. You can add a background behind your avatar, add a music track, and use a range of other tools to make the video your own. How can AI benefit photography? 8. InVideo Pros Easy to use and learn Simple but powerful Simple, two-tier pricing Article-to-text feature Cons Only the highest membership tiers have access to the best video and image libraries download This software shares a lot in look and feel with Veed.io. It has a super-simple, clean interface that is very easy to navigate. It also has a vast bank of templates for a range of needs from sports to marketing, to help you kick things off. One of its most impressive features is the AI-powered article-to-text tool. With this, you can copy and paste an article into the tool, and it will scrape the text to extract the main ideas, and then create concise content around these. It can create a unique video from an article too. Let‚Äôs say I wanted to make a video from this article ‚Äì I could just paste the URL into InVid, and the video would be created for me! This makes it the best AI video tool for batch creating multiple clips from a blog. Like Veed.io, InVideo also offers automated text-to-speech. No more need to record voiceovers, all thanks to the power of video artificial intelligence. What‚Äôs the best mobile video editing app for iPhone and Android? 9. Descript Pros Unique product Powerful editing tools Edit video with text Slick interface Cons It‚Äôs not for everyone, but that‚Äôs just me trying to find something to say download One for the podcasters. A powerful speech-to-text editor that will save you time by allowing you to edit automatically transcribed text and video voiceover at the same time. Simply put, you can record yourself, your voice and your face, and Descript uses AI to make a video and a written script from this. You can then edit that script, for example shortening long pauses in your speech, removing filler and thinking words, or removing whole phrases. Whatever you remove is also removed from the recorded footage, thereby seamlessly editing your video with AI. The software also allows you to sync your visuals with specific moments in the script, and there‚Äôs a toolbar to help you collaborate on a project with a team. Add to that powerful video editing features such as the ability to grade colours, remove backgrounds, and beef up sound quality, and you have yourself a winner. 10. FlexClip Pros Interface good for beginners Great template and stock library AI speech to text AI text to speech Cons Limited tools for pros Only exports to 1080p download This software is rich in templates and has an impressive amount of stock imagery and video you can use to inspire or pad out your videos. The interface is very simple ‚Äì it‚Äôs the best AI video editing software I tested for beginners, who will get the hang of it very easily. Once you have your footage uploaded, you have the standard range of editing tools to work with, to make your video look exactly as you want it to. You can adjust the brightness, and the speed, you can flip it around, trim it, or use FlexClip‚Äôs range of filters to automatically adjust the colours. In terms of AI video creation features, there‚Äôs speech-to-text, which can quickly generate subtitles, and text-to-speech, which can help you make natural-sounding voiceovers. 11. Rawshorts Pros Good library of resources Timesaver for small businesses Text to animation Automatic voice generator Cons Free version is quite limited download This powerful tool is specifically for people who want to make video animations. Write a script (or get ChatGPT to do that for you!) and paste it into the program. The software will then generate a voiceover, scrape your text for the main ideas, and then use those to make a coherent, animated storyboard. You‚Äôve probably seen these types of animations used on software product sales pages to explain how to use the software. This type of animation can cost thousands of dollars to produce (not to mention countless hours of drawing), but now thanks to AI, you can do it for a fraction of the time and cost. If you need to create videos for small businesses, you can imagine how much easier this clever AI video tool can make your work. 12. Lumen 5 Pros Quick and easy tool to use Text to video Good range of editing tools Cons Free version is very limited download This nifty AI video editing softwa re software helps you automatically transform blog posts, Zoom calls, or articles, into video. It‚Äôs super easy to do. For example, just paste your blog article URL into the program, and it will extract the key points to match them with relevant text and video. From there, you can tweak what you want, edit text, and swap out photos and videos from Lumen 5‚Äôs online library. You can also make talking head videos and enhance your videos with callouts and cutaways. My favourite feature is the ability to select words in the transcript (auto-generated by AI, of course!), then match the visuals directly to the timing of the audio. For video creation for social media, which often needs captions timed to voice over or talking heads, this AI video app is insanely useful. 13. SyntheSys Pros Professional-level software Text-to-video capabilities Easy-to-use dashboard Cons More expensive than other text-to-video competitors download Using SyntheSys, you can get a lifelike avatar to present a video for you, generated from text, or create a natural-sounding voiceover track. They have a library of male and female avatars, and their technology allows them to use gestures, and natural voice tones, and speak in 145 languages. It‚Äôs a great tool for businesses, or anyone wanting to quickly create human-looking and -sounding content for commercial purposes. Whether you want to remain anonymous in your video clips or simply prefer to use someone else, AI video generators like this can help speed up your video creation process. What Is the Best AI Tool to Create Videos? It really depends on what kind of video you want to create, as there is quite a diverse range of AI video generators out there for different use cases. A cinematographer or videographer is more likely to need a tool with the power and scope of Topaz Video AI or Filmora. These can really help you dive deep into your footage and create something extraordinary for professional videos. Veed.io and InVid are best for beginners or those who perhaps need video clips for personal use or smaller scale production edits. Then there are the tools that are better for small businesses, YouTubers, or for commercial use. Descript is a great tool for Youtubers and podcasters to clean up their script and video, whereas Rawshorts will help you create an animation from your script. Those looking for AI to make them a voiceover or a complete presentation with a video or even an avatar will need something different again. Lumen 5, for example, will help you create high quality videos like these, while Synthesia or SyntheSys will generate a presentation for you with a human-ish presenter. How Does an AI Video Generator Work? The computer science behind the nuts and bolts of AI video generation is beyond both my human intelligence and the scope of this article. But in simple terms, what I understand of it is that machine-learning, the machine who has learned ‚Äì which is a way of saying ‚Äòan extremely powerful computer‚Äô ‚Äì knowing language on some robotic, mathematical level, scrapes the text and converts it into computer language: numbers. As computers understand everything in these terms, the combinations of numbers it receives from the text will correspond to number patterns within videos that express the same ideas as the text. They will match. And thus, a video is born. AI Video Editing Software FAQ s What is the best AI tool to create videos? For creating videos and ease of use, I‚Äôd have to say Lumen 5 for enabling you to quickly make a coherent video from text, or SyntheSys for creating realistic avatar-led video presentations. For specific edits, Topaz Video AI can‚Äôt be beaten. Is there an AI that edits videos? Yes. For example, Topaz AI and Filmora both help you edit your videos. You can use image stabilization, change the frame rate to create natural-looking slow-motion effects, upscale your videos, and do many more things that only a year or so ago, weren‚Äôt possible. How do I know if a video was created by AI? With many ai video editing tools, you simply won‚Äôt know, and that‚Äôs increasingly the case. The AI tools in Topaz Video AI are so powerful there‚Äôs really no way of telling if that slow-motion video was originally filmed at 60 fps or 24 fps. Likewise, the human avatar you can use to give your video presentations can use natural gestures, voice tones and intonation, which can make it very difficult to know if they‚Äôre real or not. Take for example, the Deep Fake video below: It‚Äôs certainly very hard to spot if the video creation was by AI or if it was actual footage. What AI video app is everyone using? Everyone is using all of them! All of the video apps in this article are being used by someone, somewhere to save time, to be more efficient, and to create something more compelling for a variety of use cases. If I had to choose one, I‚Äôd say it was Topaz Video AI, just because that‚Äôs the world I come from, and I know that it‚Äôs a very popular resource. For another use case, I‚Äôd find it hard to believe that most podcasters weren‚Äôt using Descript, as it‚Äôs such a powerful and powerfully specialised tool. Is Synthesia Ai video free to use? No, it‚Äôs not. Synthesia is only offered on a subscription basis. AI Video Editing Tools: Final Words So there you go. Honestly, even though I wrote this article myself, my mind is a little blown. AI is so new, but it can already do so much. It‚Äôs hard to know where it‚Äôs going to lead, but although that‚Äôs a little terrifying, it‚Äôs also exciting. Especially if you‚Äôre working with video. The AI video generators and tools available to you are so powerful that they will change the way you film and the way you think about filming. Cinematographers can make 8K cinematic, slow-motion, fully stabilized footage from 1080p footage filmed on an old camera. YouTubers can make video content of themselves with all their thinking words removed. Businesses can make promo videos, voiceovers or video presentations without hiring voiceover artists. It‚Äôs head-spinning! Doesn‚Äôt it make you want to create AI generated videos just to see how incredible the technology has become? If you‚Äôre not already using AI video generators in some form, it definitelt feels like right now is the time to start.

Here's what we found. In today's world of powerful generative AI tools, having a top-tier AI video generator in your metaphorical back pocket is like having your own personal Hollywood film crew at your service. In fact, AI video generators are now so capable that major brands are switching from old video production methods to these modern AI-powered ones. Even the Tribeca Film Festival and other players in the film industry are jumping aboard the AI movement, highlighting just how dynamic and impressive these tools are becoming. But if you're reading this and think it sounds like AI video generators are just for the creative pros, don't worry because that's not the case. With AI text-to-video, AI-generated avatars, and tons of other awesome new AI video features, literally anyone can create unbelievably high-quality content. I made this anime trailer, and I think it‚Äôs pretty cool. The pictures, animation, and even the song were all generated by AI. Let me break down the process and tell you how it was done üëá pic.twitter.com/Y117zidiei ‚Äî Framer üá±üáπ (@0xFramer) August 22, 2024 But with so many options flooding the market, it can be tough to figure out which tool is the right fit for you. Each promises to be the best, but how do you know which will deliver on that promise and actually be the best AI video generator? We made this guide to help you navigate the crowded field and find the tool that suits your needs. We've carefully selected and reviewed seven top contenders, focusing on what they offer, where they excel, and where they might fall short. So, if you've ever wondered, \"What is the best AI video generator?\" you're in the right place. What is an AI video generator? In the simplest of terms, an AI video generator is a tool that uses artificial intelligence to automate the video creation process. Instead of manually editing clips, adding effects, and syncing audio, these tools handle the heavy lifting for you. You just input text, images, or other media, and AI turns that into a complete video through text to video generation. By using AI, these tools automatically select the best visuals, create smooth transitions, and even generate voiceovers with realistic AI avatars. This means you can focus more on crafting your message and less on getting bogged down in the technical details. How do AI video generators work? AI video generators work by using advanced algorithms to analyze and process your input, whether it‚Äôs text, images, or other media. When you provide the content, the AI interprets it and makes decisions about how to structure the video. This includes selecting visuals, syncing audio, and applying effects‚Äîall in a matter of minutes. ‚ú® From Photo AI image to video with @LumaLabsAI's video model that came out today called Dream Machine It's absolutely state of the art and the best video model available right now I think It's able to highly accurately predict 3d surroundings from just a photo, I think up‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/KDetDBdGIS ‚Äî @levelsio (@levelsio) June 13, 2024 At the core of these tools is machine learning, which allows the AI to improve over time. The more data it processes, the better it becomes at making creative decisions that result in high-quality videos. For example, if you input a script, the AI video tool can generate corresponding scenes, choose relevant images or video clips, and even create a voiceover. The process is surprisingly intuitive. You simply provide the material, and the AI organizes it into a cohesive video that aligns with your vision. How we chose the best AI video generators To ensure you pick the best AI video generators and generative AI editing tools, we chose products that truly deliver on their promises of creating amazing videos. No matter how skilled you are at video editing, you need an AI tool that simplifies the process. Next, we evaluated the range of features. A great AI video maker should offer more than just basic editing‚Äîit should allow you to customize and tweak your video clips until they look like they were made by a professional film crew. We also compared the pricing plans, ensuring that they offer a solid mix of features without breaking the bank. Our goal was to find tools that help you save time and money. ‚Äç 1. AI Studios by Deepbrain AI DeepBrain AI‚Äôs video generator is a robust all-in-one tool that brings realistic AI avatars, natural text-to-speech, and intuitive video creation into one seamless platform. Whether you‚Äôre making educational videos, marketing content, or AI-powered presentations, it streamlines the entire process with easy-to-use tools and customizable features.

You can pair these avatars with lifelike AI voices, customize their look, and even use templates to get a head start. Tools like script generation, voice cloning, and text-to-speech make content creation feel effortless, even if you‚Äôre not a video editing pro. Why we like AI Studios by Deepbrain AI: New and powerful For teams, DeepBrain AI shines with collaborative features that let you sync up in a shared workspace. Add to that the ability to export videos in multiple formats, and you‚Äôve got a powerful tool for turning ideas into polished videos ‚Äì fast. Whether you're experimenting with the free plan or scaling up with Team and Enterprise options, the flexibility here ensures there‚Äôs something for everyone. Where AI Studios could improve We love the power and usability of this tool, but since they are relatively new to the space, they could benefit from more brand recognition. Once more people are familiar with this tool and how it can help with creative workflow, we are confident it will be a go-to product for designers and creatives of all stripes. Pricing options: Free plan ($0.00) Personal ($24.00/month) Team ($55.00/month) Enterprise (Custom) 2. Luma Dream Machine Dream Machine by Luma Labs is a video creation tool that uses AI to generate extremely lifelike videos. You can quickly turn your images or text prompts into professional-looking clips. The process of creating a video takes just a couple of minutes. Each video is about five seconds long and can include multiple shots, making them richer and more detailed than many competitors‚Äô outputs. During my tests, some videos were ready quickly, while others took longer, but all captured motion better than any other tool I‚Äôve tried. Whether you're crafting an epic scene or a visually intense moment, Dream Machine captures the essence of storytelling with visuals that feel straight out of Hollywood. Created product mockup videos with Luma Dream Machine V1.5 text-to-video model, and I‚Äôm really happy with the results. You can find the prompts in the thread, and you can use the same ones with Midjourney or Flux.#LumaDreamMachine pic.twitter.com/VISWZK8TEp ‚Äî Gizem Akdag (@gizakdag) August 21, 2024 Why we like Dream Machine: Most cinematic If you're a creator with a flair for the cinematic, you're going to love making videos with Dream Machine. What really stands out is that you don't need precise details for motion areas, Dream Machine still manages to capture motion concepts effectively. Itfollows the laws of physics, ensuring that every shot feels grounded and realistic. Plus, it‚Äôs super fast! As their website mentions, Dream Machine can currently produce 120 frames in 120 seconds, which is not too shabby to say the least. Where Dream Machine could improve Although Dream Machine is generally fast, some users have experienced slower processing times when working on intricate projects with a lot of elements. The discard rate can be around 98% with Reddit users pointing that most of the videos generated are unusable because of random elements, incorrect motion, or distortion. Pricing options: Free Plan ($0.00) Lite Plan ($7.99/month) Standard Plan ($23.99/month) Plus Plan ($51.99/month) Pro Plan ($79.99/month) 3. Runway Gen-3 Alpha Runway calls their latest model, Gen-3 Alpha, the new frontier for video generation, and we are here to say that they could definitely be right. The Gen-3 Alpha supports text to video, image to video, advanced camera control, multi motion brush, and after testing some of these features out, we were seriously impressed by how smooth and sharp the results are. The video creation workflow feels super streamlined, thanks to the improved fidelity and motion‚Äîit‚Äôs clear this model was built for powerful things. Add expressiveness and intention to your generations with Multi Motion Brush. Learn how with today's Runway Academy: https://t.co/EUbxc4aA0D pic.twitter.com/qredD7vsXu ‚Äî Runway (@runwayml) January 23, 2024 Why we like Runway: Most dynamic Runway's Gen-3 Alpha is one of the most impressive AI video generators we‚Äôve come across. Not only is it a powerful tool for video that makes content creation seem limitless, but it has a shockingly friendly interface and is easy to use. With the Multi Motion Brush, you can select up to five areas with independent motion and control across 3 directional axis (x, y, z) for more precise and expressive generations. Another highlight is how well it handles human-like characters. The AI generates lifelike figures with natural expressions and gestures, adding a level of realism that‚Äôs hard to beat. We aren't exaggerating when we say you'll likely be blown away by what you generate with this tool. The videos are truly cinematic and offer an exciting glimpse into the future of creativity. Where Runway could improve Runway is an extraordinary tool, so it is hard to say where it can improve. Of course, with such a dynamic AI video generator comes cost, which might be the only thing holding back casual users or if you're on a budget. Plus, it is true that sometimes the final results might look a little \"wonky,\" but overall the quality is top-tier. Pricing options: Basic Plan ($0 per editor per month) Standard Plan ($12 per user per month, billed annually as $144) Pro Plan ($28 per user per month, billed annually as $336) Unlimited Plan ($76 per user per month, billed annually as $912) Enterprise Plan (Customized with Runway team) 4. Hailuo AI Hailuo AI is an AI-powered video generator designed to make content creation simple but still extraordinary. Whether you‚Äôre making cinematic videos for marketing, detailedproduct explainers, or social media ads, this tool automates the heavy lifting‚Äîgiving you professional-looking results in minutes. Instead of spending hours fine-tuning every frame, creators can focus on storytelling while the AI ensures smooth motion, clean edits, and stunning visuals. #Hailuo AI is absolutely insane for creating Hollywood-style blockbuster scenes! üé¨üî• Every test is a thrill pic.twitter.com/idaAJWb2BZ ‚Äî Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) March 6, 2025 Why we like Hailuo AI: Fast yet eye-popping For businesses and content creators who need speed, flexibility, and truly remarkable videos, Hailuo AI delivers. One of the standout features is its customizable templates, which allow users to tweak layouts, colors, and visual styles without advanced editing skills. So regardless of what kind of content you ar making, whether it's onboarding video or a marketing campaign, Hailuo AI makes sure your content looks tailored, not cookie-cutter. Where Hailuo AI Could Improve While the AI does a great job with automation, some users may find the customization options a bit limited. For example, while templates are helpful, they don‚Äôt always allow for fine-grained control over pacing and scene composition. Additionally, industries needing highly specific branding‚Äîlike film production or high-end advertising‚Äîmight need more flexibility in motion effects and camera angles. Pricing options: Standard plan ($14.90 per month) Unlimited plan ($94.90 per month) 5. Kling AI The Kling AI video generator produces highly realistic 1080p videos up to two minutes long, all from a single prompt. The key difference? It doesn‚Äôt just generate good-looking footage‚Äîit ensures movements and physics behave naturally, making everything feel more lifelike. Have an Amazing Day!‚òÄÔ∏èüôÇ‚òïÔ∏è Name: Flower Care Made with @Kling_ai 1.6 Text to Video#AIart Good Monday #MondayMotivation #Mondayvibes pic.twitter.com/MEvNj9HVrw ‚Äî Jay Kay (@JayKay65220066) March 10, 2025 Why we like Kling AI: Smooth, natural motion What sets Kling apart is how well it captures human motion and expression. Thanks to its 3D face and body reconstruction technology, characters move fluidly and show natural emotions‚Äîall from a single image. Its physics engine also shines, allowing for believable object interactions and environments that behave like real-world scenes. Whether you're creating short films, virtual influencers, or AI-generated marketing content, Kling delivers a level of realism that‚Äôs hard to match. Where Kling AI could improve While Kling is impressive, it‚Äôs not perfect. Some users report slow processing times, especially for highly detailed scenes. Occasionally, minor inconsistencies appear, like hand distortions or subtle motion glitches. More control over camera angles and fine-tuning details would make it even stronger for professional creators. Pricing options: Basic (free) Standard ($72.90 yearly) Pro ($293.04 yearly) Premier ($728.64 yearly) 6. revid AI This tool might be new on the scene, but for improving video productivity for socials, revid is quickly becoming one of our favorites. Their mission is all about helping creators like you make short videos that have a potential to go viral. Why we like revid AI: Best for social media What we like most about revid AI is that it has a specific focus. The AI does the heavy lifting from finding ideas, adding sound effects, creating scripts, and then transforming everything into viral videos for your social media content. It‚Äôs a company that knows its lane, and we can certainly appreciate its dedication to being the master of one instead of the jack of all AI video trades. Where revid AI could improve The main drawback with revid AI is that it is niche. This is fine if you need this specific type of content, but it may be lacking if you're searching for a more powerful tool. Pricing options Hobby ($49/month) Growth (Launch offer $49/month) Ultra ($199/month) 7. Colossyan Whether you're making screen recordings for employee training, video marketing content for social media platforms, or educational videos for compliance training, Colossyan offers features that simplify video making for established businesses. Why we like Colossyan: Best for large businesses Colossyan is awesome with AI video editing, offering tools like prompt to video and AI script assistants that help you create excellent videos without needing tons of experience. While it is definitely on the more corporate side of video creation, we saw this tool streamline the creation process and make it easy to produce high-quality generated videos super fast and efficiently. Plus, Colossyan‚Äôs extensive library of AI avatars and multilingual support make it a nice choice for large companies and diverse clients. Where Colossyan could improve While Colossyan has a ton of cool features, it may require a bit of a learning curve for those new to AI video tools. The sheer number of options, from AI avatars to multiple export formats, can be overwhelming for beginners. Pricing options Starter Plan ($19/month, annually) Pro Plan ($61/month, billed annually) Enterprise Plan (Custom Pricing) 8. HeyGen HeyGen is one of the more impressive platforms we tested. A big reason for this is because it is hassle-free and easy to use, so jumping in was a simple process. More specifically, HeyGen is one of the best when it comes to generating AI avatars. The process of creating a HeyGen avatar boils down to three steps: choosing or creating an avatar, recording or choosing a voice to go with it, selecting a video template, then letting HeyGen put it all together in a matter of minutes. Why we like HeyGen: Most intriguing video generator One of the coolest features of HeyGen is its AI avatars, which are constantly evolving. The platform frequently updates these avatars to include enhanced visual details, expanded speech abilities, and more lifelike animations. Another great feature is the change videos to multiple langauges. HeyGen allows you to create videos in over forty languages from your original video, letting you reach audiences from all parts of the world. Where HeyGen could improve While HeyGen offers a lot of flexibility, the pricing for the Team plan might be higher for smaller teams or individual creators. Additionally, the Free plan, although great for beginners, limits users to just 3 videos per month, which may not be enough for those who need to produce content regularly. Pricing options Free Plan ($0) Creator Plan ($24/mo) Team Plan ($69/seat/mo) Enterprise Plan (Custom Pricing) 9. Haiper AI After diving into Haiper AI, we quickly realized it‚Äôs a promising tool for anyone looking to explore the world of AI-driven video creation. One of the first things that stood out to us is how Haiper AI makes the video creation process both accessible and efficient, even for those just starting. With just 3 images, @escelce transported us through 3 different universes, holy cow! #KeyframeConditioning #AIvideo #MadeWithHaiper https://t.co/6FwlLObhIK pic.twitter.com/JZdJOq3QMb ‚Äî Haiper AI (@HaiperGenAI) August 19, 2024 Why we like Haiper AI: Best for beginners What we appreciated most about Haiper AI is its flexibility and how user friendly it was. The platform allows for up to 10 creations per day on the Free plan, which is generous for a no-cost option. That, on top of the text-to-speech feature helps make Haiper a solid tool. For those who need more, the Explorer and Pro plans offer expanded features that cater to different levels of use. Where Haiper AI could improve One of the primary limitations is that the Free plan doesn‚Äôt allow for commercial use or watermark-free videos. This might be a dealbreaker for users who need to produce content for business purposes but aren‚Äôt ready to invest in a paid plan. Pricing options Free Plan (Beta, $0/month): Explorer Plan (Beta, $8/month, billed yearly) Pro Plan (Beta, $24/month, billed yearly) Enterprise APIs (Custom Pricing) ‚Äç 10. Synthesia Synthesia is a game-changer for simplifying the process of making (sometimes scarily) realistic AI avatars. With simple text-based prompts, Synthesia turns your script into a polished, video ready project featuring life-like avatars. Why we like Synthesia: Excellent for avatars Even if you're new to video Synthesia has an intuitive interface that makes creating and editing your video feel straightforward. You simply choose an avatar, input your text prompts, and watch as the AI works its magic, transforming your words into engaging content. Plus, the AI video editor allows you to tweak and refine your video, so you can take the time to make those small changes that really make your vision come to life. So whether it is explainer videos, content creation for blog posts, or other marketing projects, Synthesia is excellent for businesses who want to make videos for their products or services. Where Synthesia could improve One of the main limitations is the degree of control available for the AI avatars. The avatars do look polished, but the options for appearance and expressions are somewhat limited compared to more advanced tools. Pricing Options Free Plan (‚Ç¨0/mo) Starter Plan (‚Ç¨20/mo) Creator Plan (‚Ç¨59/mo) Enterprise Plan (custom pricing) ‚Äç ‚Äç Wrapping up: The future of AI Video Tools AI in video and avatar creation has come a long way.

The AI interprets the prompt and generates a matching video, complete with movement, lighting, and even physics. This is by far the most popular type of AI video generation. Image-to-video Look at that VEO 2 animates windows wallpaper! pic.twitter.com/qL51V8S4oA ‚Äî testtm (@test_tm7873) December 26, 2024 Image-to-video AI video generation animates static images, bringing them to life with motion effects. AI can generate smooth transitions, camera movements, or even animate characters from a few frames. Image-to-video models are popular with AI video creators because they allow you to maintain character, scene and object consistency throughout your video. You would typically use these tools alongside an AI image generator like Midjourney. Video-to-video @runwayml has 4K upscaling now! ü§Ø I did a comparison between Runway GEN-3 and Topaz Video AI's upscaler, from HD to 4K.

This can include improving video quality, changing styles, adding special effects, or even altering elements within the footage‚Äîlike removing objects, or replacing backgrounds. Some good examples of video-to-video includes Synthesia's AI dubbing (with lip sync) or Topaz's video upscaling. Th‚Äée best AI video generator for studio-quality videos with AI avatars Synthesia PlayCreate an AI Video in 4 Minutes with Synthesia ‚ö°Ô∏è Verdict: Easy to use and great for training, internal communications, marketing, outreach and localisation/translation ‚ÄéLink: ‚Äéhttps://www.synthesia.io/ Synthesia is a leading AI video generator that allows you to create studio-quality videos with AI avatars that can narrate your text. It includes more than 60 video templates you can start from, and you can choose between more than 230 AI avatars that speak more than 140 languages and accents. Here's an example video I made for a product launch: PlayProduct Introduction (Free AI Video Template) Synthesia can be used to create a variety of video types, with the most common use cases being learning and development videos, including training videos and other eLearning video production. It also excels at producing onboarding videos and video content for internal communications, as well as marketing and outreach videos. Synthesia is a top-ranked AI software, with 1150+ reviews on G2 and has a rating of 4.7 out of 5. The platform is being used by 50,000 companies of all sizes, with many big names among them, such as Reuters, Zoom, and Amazon. Synthesia is a browser-based platform and I found it easy to set up my first video. I simply typed in my script, selected an avatar from their library, customized my video with the AI video editor, and then Synthesia generated a polished video featuring one of its realistic AI avatars. With over 230 avatars to choose from, I easily found options that fit different tones and purposes. You can also make a custom avatar that looks like you. Synthesia supports over 140 languages, and I was able to create localized versions of my video with ease. The platform even has a multilingual video player that automatically translates videos to viewers‚Äô preferred languages, making it useful for global audiences. I tried adding multiple avatars on screen to simulate conversations, which worked smoothly and could be helpful for training scenarios or role-playing videos. The platform has over 60 professionally designed video templates that make it easy to produce polished content quickly. Features like live collaboration tools allow teams to work together seamlessly, while detailed video analytics provide insights into video performance. Altogether, these capabilities make Synthesia a practical, efficient choice for professional projects. One of its most popular use cases is as training video software, but it's also great for other sales and marketing videos and multilingual content. Th‚Äée best AI video generators for creative video production Here's my rundown of the best text-to-video and image-to-video AI video generators for creative video production. Hailuo Hailuo Director Mode is so fun. Being able to combine camera shots is just fantastic. Here shaky camera and push in. pic.twitter.com/MfqBA22vm8 ‚Äî Jerrod Lew (@jerrod_lew) February 1, 2025 Verdict: The best free option for creative video production Link: ‚Äéhttps://hailuoai.video/ Hailuo AI is an AI video generator that delivers high-quality 6-second video clips at 720p resolution. It offers text-to-video, image-to-video and a subject reference feature. Hailuo offers a 3-day free unlimited generation period so that you can generate a bunch of videos for free and really test the tool. Subject reference is a particularly cool feature. It lets you upload a photo of a character and then generate a scene with that character in it. I found the output to be pretty accurate, although I often needed to do some manual editing to maintain coherence. The model can also take multiple attempts to get it right, which will eat into your credits. The feature also often fails at close-ups (wide shots tend to work better but lose fine details). One of the first things that stood out to me was how well it understands prompts. Hailuo seemed to nail camera movements and scene composition accurately. The image quality is also noticeably high. However, generation times are limited to 6 seconds, which makes creating longer sequences more tedious. Al‚Äéibaba Qwen Another day, another release. Alibaba have quietly included video generation in their release of Qwen 2.5 Max and it's really good. Here are a few examples - check them out. pic.twitter.com/u6qptO59ai ‚Äî TomLikesRobotsü§ñ (@TomLikesRobots) January 30, 2025 Verdict: Completely free and produces high quality videos, but often with unreliable generation Link: ‚Äé‚Äé‚Äé‚Äéhttps://chat.qwenlm.ai/ Alibaba included an AI video generator in their release of Qwen 2.5 Max. It‚Äôs a text-to-video only tool, but it‚Äôs completely free and I‚Äôve been impressed by the quality. The one catch is that the generation is kind of unreliable. I often enter my prompt and the video generates up to 99% complete and then gets stuck for quite a while. In my experience the videos do eventually finish generating but be prepared to wait a little. The output quality seems to be really good, and while the functionality is limited, it‚Äôs completely free and the videos have no watermark. Kl‚Äéing If you‚Äôre looking to combine character consistency with high-quality VFX, @Kling_ai is the best choice. üé•‚ú® Version 1.5 absolutely nails VFX. A true must-have! üöÄ pic.twitter.com/rO1WvmLj3k ‚Äî Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) January 12, 2025 Verdict: High quality output, but very long free plan generation wait times Link: ‚Äéhttps://www.klingai.com/ Kling offers text-to-video and image-to-video features, along with free video generation credits for users who log in each month. Kling brings an impressive level of fluidity and realism to movement in videos. I found the adjustable creativity and relevance slider particularly useful for fine-tuning outputs. Its biggest strength lies in image-to-video generation (and in particular its elements feature), which is far superior to tools like Runway. The motion is smoother, and the AI follows prompts accurately. When I asked for a character to blink or walk forward while the camera zoomed in, Kling delivered exactly what I asked for. If you need storytelling or consistency between frames, Kling is a great option. Kling 1.5 also supports HD, which is a nice bonus. Kling has some drawbacks, the biggest being generation speed. On the free version, I sometimes had to wait an hour or more for a single clip, and I‚Äôve heard of free users waiting a full day for results. This is a major issue if you need quick iterations. On a paid plan the generations are quicker, but I also noticed that Kling sometimes gets stuck at 99% completion and wastes credits. At the end of the day, if you prioritize quality, accuracy, and motion control, Kling is a great choice. The motion brush tool adds extra control, and the first-attempt success rate is high, meaning I spent less time fighting the AI to get what I wanted. Ru‚Äénway When setting up a shot in Runway, think carefully about where to put the camera. Consider what the camera placement tells the audience about the story, about the character, and about the moment. Every angle is a decision that affects how the audience will experience it. pic.twitter.com/XnijHcb0Jv ‚Äî Crist√≥bal Valenzuela (@c_valenzuelab) November 11, 2024 Verdict: The Gen-3 model gives you great results and some amazing advanced features that come with a bit of a learning curve Link: ‚Äéhttps://runwayml.com/ Runway‚Äôs latest Gen-3 model offers a comprehensive suite of creative tools, such as text-to-video, image-to-video, and video-to-video, alongside advanced features like motion brush, keyframes, camera controls and inpainting. On the free basic plan, you can create short text-to-video clips (up to 10 seconds long or 16 seconds using the \"extend video\" feature in the older Gen-2 model) but can‚Äôt upscale resolution or remove watermarks. You also can‚Äôt generate videos directly from text using their Gen-3 Alpha model on the free plan (only images to video). However, you can still make great videos with just the image-video feature. Here's an example workflow to show you how I use Runway‚Äôs free plan to create AI-generated short story videos: Midjourney to generate images Runway for image-to-video Suno to generate music Elevenlabs for some effects Topaz for video upscaling Capcut for editing I found Runway‚Äôs advanced features to be pretty amazing. Camera control lets you adjust angles, focus, and movement to achieve a polished, professional look. The Motion brush tool allows you to add motion and direction to specific parts of a video, which is great for creating visually dynamic social media content. Keyframes allow you to configure the starting, middle, and ending frames to create smooth transitions between them. Inpainting lets you automatically remove unwanted objects throughout your clip. This tool handled complex scenes surprisingly well; I could remove background elements without affecting the continuity of the video, something that would usually require a lot of time and expertise. However, I found that these advanced features come with a learning curve, so if you‚Äôre new to video editing you might need a bit of practice to fully utilize Runway‚Äôs capabilities. I found Runway‚Äôs video generation process to be fast and reliable. I think the pricing is reasonable given the platform‚Äôs capabilities, especially for creators, filmmakers, and digital artists who want more control and creative freedom. However, the costs might feel high if you‚Äôre only looking for basic AI video generation, as Runway is designed for those looking to push creative boundaries and explore the possibilities of AI in video production. Go‚Äéogle Veo Been generating impossibly dangerous stunts with veo 2 using text prompts. Still surprising how realistic they can look (though not perfect yet). pic.twitter.com/0gETBwGH5y ‚Äî Ethan Mollick (@emollick) February 1, 2025 Verdict: The best option for creative video production, but limited access for now (US only waitlist) Link: ‚Äéhttps://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/ I was blown away by Google Veo 2‚Äôs realistic video generation capabilities. Every clip I produced, from a misty jungle scene to a foggy wildlife sequence, was rendered in stunning detail, and the visual fidelity was top-notch. One of the aspects that stood out for me was the advanced cinematic controls. I could specify everything from lens types to shot angles and even adjust depth-of-field effects, which made it feel like I had an entire professional film crew at my fingertips. The dolly zoom and pan shot features, in particular, added that extra layer of cinematic flair that really brought my scenes to life. In my tests, Veo 2 consistently produced more ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù results compared to other tools like OpenAI‚Äôs Sora. The physics simulation is fantastic with objects and characters that move and interact in a way that feels natural and true to real-world behavior. I found that character consistency was excellent too; no matter how complex the scene, the generated characters maintained their look and identity throughout the video. Veo 2 supports high-resolution outputs (up to 4K) and longer video durations too, which simplifies your workflow as you won‚Äôt need upscaling tools. The only reason why Veo 2 isn‚Äôt my top pick for creative video production is because it‚Äôs still not publicly available - you have to join a waitlist and it‚Äôs still US only. There‚Äôs also room for improvement still, and I sometimes saw some strange character movements in my generated videos. Op‚ÄéenAI Sora üö® It‚Äôs crazy! #Sora just dropped, and it‚Äôs already blowing everyone‚Äôs minds! üò±üé• Here are 10 mind-blowing examples showcasing its insane possibilities. üî• The future of video is here. üöÄüëá pic.twitter.com/Mcq2OepO3R ‚Äî Pierrick Chevallier | IA (@CharaspowerAI) December 9, 2024 Verdict: Fun to play around with but needs to improve Link: ‚Äéhttps://sora.com/ Sora is OpenAI‚Äôs entry into text-to-video AI video generation, and after spending some time with it, I‚Äôve found it to be a mixed bag. On the one hand, when Sora works, it can deliver stunning, lifelike visuals, especially for abstract or artistic scenes. Its storyboard functionality is one of my favorite features, as it lets you prompt multiple shots in a single generation, and the ‚ÄúBlend‚Äù option adds a fun layer of creativity, allowing you to combine visual elements in unexpected ways. However, in my experience the model struggles with some critical aspects. Sora consistently fails when it comes to physics, general body movements, and character consistency. For example, I tried generating scenes as simple as making cats dance, only to be met with choppy motion, glitches, and overall results that were far from convincing. In several cases, the outputs felt like a gamble: some generations might be passable, but most of the time, prompts didn‚Äôt translate well into the expected actions or camera movements. I found that free or cheaper alternatives outperform Sora in accuracy and usability. There‚Äôs a steep learning curve, and despite the potential of the video-to-video remix functionality (which I‚Äôve used to remaster some older AI-generated clips), the overall inconsistency is hard to overlook. You can access Sora on the plus plan ($20/month) which gives you 50 videos up to 720p resolution and 5 seconds long, or the pro plan ($200/month) for 500 videos up to 1080p resolution and 20 seconds long. Pi‚Äéka I had early access to the Pika 2.1 Model, A new journey begins, More clips to follow! @pika_labs pic.twitter.com/rN5OfMacoo ‚Äî Stevie Mac (@StevieMac03) January 23, 2025 Verdict: The free plan isn‚Äôt great, but the premium plans have very good image-to-video features Link: ‚Äéhttps://pika.art/ Pika offers a free plan that gives you access to Pika 1.5, which has text-to-video and image-to-video features and 150 monthly video credits. Videos can be downloaded without a watermark on the free plan. I wasn‚Äôt super impressed with the quality of the generated videos though. However, while Pika 1.5‚Äôs video output is nothing special, Pika 2.1 (available on the paid plan) offers an image-to-video feature called scene ingredients, which I think is pretty amazing. With scene ingredients you can build a shot from the exact character, object, wardrobe, and setting you want. It works by using reference images of each element and then providing a prompt. It‚Äôs similar to Kling‚Äôs elements feature in that it allows you to ensure creative consistency between scenes, which I found made it a super useful tool to produce actually usable videos. Lu‚Äéma First impression Luma > Sora pic.twitter.com/R2pXVsAesw ‚Äî The Retro Burn (@burntheretro) December 9, 2024 Verdict: Their new Ray 2 model is great, but it‚Äôs a premium feature and it doesn‚Äôt offer image-to-video Link: ‚Äéhttps://lumalabs.ai/ Luma's Ray 2 model has great motion realism and the physics feel really natural. The frame-to-frame consistency is a clear improvement over previous versions and it does an excellent job with cinematic elements, responding impressively to lighting, contrast, film formats, and camera motion. At times, it even seemed to intelligently structure shots. By using highly detailed prompts and running multiple generations, I found that it‚Äôs possible to create some truly stunning videos, though it does require some cherry-picking to get the best results. When I tested a sports car driving through snowy mountains at dawn, the scene composition was spot on and the snow, warm light, and camera tracking all felt smooth and natural. I also experimented with close-up shots of faces, and I was surprised by how well it captured emotional expressions, particularly in an extreme sadness prompt, where the eye movements and facial subtleties felt incredibly lifelike. Where Luma stands out is its ability to generate dynamic camera movements while keeping the scene coherent. It understands cinematic depth and framing in a way that makes it ideal for dramatic shots. I found that Luma is great at handling large-scale scene changes. For example, when I asked it to generate a collapsing building Luma delivered a convincing destruction sequence. Currently, Luma‚Äôs Ray 2 is only available to paid users and is capped at 720p resolution. Videos can be up to 10 seconds long, but I noticed that after about 7 seconds, scene consistency can start breaking down, occasionally shifting in unintended ways. Ad‚Äéobe Firefly Here's another video created by Adobe Firefly.. a 3D printer, printing a car. Very impressed by the results. https://t.co/L5d8zf3TGv pic.twitter.com/ySylkRlDMS ‚Äî techAU (@techAU) February 13, 2025 Verdict: Inconsistent motion and limited free use (only 2 free generations) make it hard to recommend Link: ‚Äé‚Äéhttps://firefly.adobe.com/ Adobe Firefly offers both text to video and image to video, both capable of producing 1080p clips from simple prompts or static images. Firefly struggles with distortion. I tested it by generating a video of \"a cyclist riding through a mountain trail in autumn,\" and while the colors and scenery were nice, the motion was noticeably unnatural. The cyclist's legs appeared to glitch mid-pedal, and the overall movement felt disjointed. Image to video fared better when creating abstract or background footage, but realistic human action remained a challenge. The output currently feels more like digital experiments than polished, usable content. On the positive side, Firefly's interface is intuitive. The built-in controls for adjusting camera angles, motion paths, and shot sizes make experimenting with different styles relatively simple. After generating two free videos, I was prompted to upgrade to either Firefly Standard or Pro for additional generations. While Firefly is enjoyable to explore and has clear creative potential, I‚Äôll stick with more reliable alternatives for projects that need high-quality, natural-looking results. The best AI video generators for social media and YouTube content Fl‚ÄéexClip PlayHow to use FlexClip's AI Video Creator Verdict: User-friendly video tool with innovative AI features Link: ‚Äéhttps://www.flexclip.com/ FlexClip is highly user-friendly platform that excels at helping you create professional-looking videos quickly and efficiently. I love the drag-and-drop editor. It‚Äôs perfect for creating videos on the fly without needing to spend hours on intricate editing. I‚Äôve used it to create everything from social media content to promotional videos. The AI-powered text-to-video tool allows you to input simple text prompts, and the AI generates video clips based on the text, matching stock footage, adding text overlays, and even suggesting music. It's perfect for social media clips. While the AI can be a little hit or miss when it comes to perfectly matching footage to specific content, it‚Äôs an amazing tool for creating videos when you‚Äôre short on time or just need a draft to build upon, and I typically only need to make a few adjustments after generation. The AI script generator is another great feature. While the scripts are generally a good starting point, they often need a little fine-tuning to match the specific tone of the brand or subject matter. This is definitely a time-saver, though, especially when you‚Äôre stuck trying to put ideas into words. Another feature that impressed me was the AI background remover. It works surprisingly well. For most images, the background removal is clean, though it sometimes struggles with more intricate details like hair or small objects. It‚Äôs a great time-saver when you‚Äôre working with product images or need transparent backgrounds quickly. FlexClip also offers an auto-subtitle generator, which is a great tool for improving accessibility and engagement on social media platforms. It‚Äôs surprisingly accurate, and I‚Äôve used it for videos on YouTube and Instagram. However, it does occasionally struggle with fast speech or complex accents, so if you‚Äôre working with content that has unclear audio, this may not always be 100% reliable. One area where FlexClip could improve is its media library. While it offers a decent range of stock footage and images, it‚Äôs not as extensive as some other platforms I‚Äôve used. For niche content, I‚Äôve often had to source additional media from other places. The stock library is good for general-purpose videos, but it may not always have exactly what you need. Ve‚Äéed PlayHow to Make a YouTube Intro Verdict: User-friendly browser-based video editor that streamlines social media content creation Link: ‚Äéhttps://www.veed.io/ Veed is a user-friendly, browser-based video editor that made creating social media content incredibly easy for me. The intuitive layout and drag-and-drop functionality let me start projects quickly, and I loved using features like automatic subtitles, text-to-speech, and background removal to give my videos a professional touch. The templates and filters helped keep my style consistent, and with auto-translate, creating multilingual content was straightforward. The only downside I found was that the free plan includes a watermark, and complex scenes sometimes required a bit of manual tweaking to get the AI effects like background removal just right. Overall, Veed offered everything I needed for quick, polished videos with minimal effort. Ca‚Äénva PlayCreate content fast with Canva Video Verdict: AI-powered video editing with versatile templates Link: ‚Äéhttps://www.canva.com/video-editor/ai/ Canva is not only a design tool; it‚Äôs also a great alternative for creating social media and YouTube videos. I tried its video editor, and I was impressed by how well it adapts to video creation. Canva‚Äôs templates make it easy to start projects tailored for platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. One of my favorite features is the automatic resizing, which lets me quickly reformat videos for different platforms without needing to start from scratch. The AI-powered suggestions for text and animations are also handy‚Äîit feels like Canva‚Äôs tools know how to keep my content consistent and visually engaging. With access to a vast library of stock media and music, I could easily enhance my videos, and the new AI text-to-speech and captioning features were a nice bonus, especially for making my videos more accessible. Overall, Canva‚Äôs video editing tools made it simple to produce polished, shareable content that looks just as good as anything created with dedicated video editors. The best AI-powered video editors Fi‚Äélmora PlayFilmora 14 is HERE! | Introducing a NEW way to edit Verdict: An affordable and user-friendly video editor with robust AI features Link: ‚Äéhttps://filmora.wondershare.com/ When I first tried Filmora, I was immediately struck by how easy it was to navigate. The drag-and-drop functionality and straightforward interface made it simple to start editing, even without much prior experience. Filmora offers a robust library of transitions, effects, and templates, allowing me to quickly put together visually appealing videos, which is ideal for creating content for social media and YouTube. I appreciated how the platform balances usability with a range of features, making it suitable for both beginners and intermediate users who want to produce polished videos without a steep learning curve. Filmora‚Äôs pricing is also accessible, with options that cater to different types of users. They offer an annual subscription starting at around $49.99 per year, and for those looking for more flexibility, a lifetime license is available for around $79.99. There‚Äôs also a free version, which is great for testing the software before committing, but it does add a watermark to videos. For creators looking to edit consistently without major financial commitments, Filmora‚Äôs pricing offers a good balance of affordability and value, especially considering the powerful AI tools it includes. These plans are well-suited for individuals and small business owners who need regular access to professional-grade video tools without breaking the bank. Filmora's AI-powered tools bring a lot of convenience and creativity to the editing process. I'll run through each one. The AI Smart Cutout feature, for example, allows you to cut objects out of scenes by painting over the area, which is perfect for isolating specific subjects without complex masking. I also found AI Audio Denoise to be extremely useful for cleaning up background noise in my videos, especially when I recorded in less-than-ideal environments. The AI Audio Stretch tool was another handy feature that let me extend background music to match scene transitions, saving me the hassle of remixing or finding perfectly timed tracks. These AI tools are not only time-saving but also elevate the overall quality of the final video, helping users create professional-looking content with minimal effort. The AI Motion Tracking tool was a lot of fun to experiment with‚Äîit can be used to track faces or moving objects, allowing for privacy blurring or creative effects like pasting funny stickers over someone‚Äôs face to make meme-style videos. Another feature I really enjoyed was AI Remove Background, which made it easy to change the background of my videos without needing a green screen. I could, for instance, place a runner in an outer-space setting, which opens up endless creative possibilities. Additionally, Filmora‚Äôs AI Silence Detection tool helped speed up my editing by automatically removing pauses and hesitations, making it effortless to create snappy jump cuts. These tools make Filmora an efficient, AI-enhanced option for quick edits and visually dynamic effects. However, while these AI tools are great for general use, there are a few limitations. The precision of features like Smart Cutout and Remove Background isn‚Äôt perfect and might require manual touch-ups for complex scenes. Additionally, while Filmora handles most tasks smoothly, rendering can slow down when working with high-resolution files or when using multiple AI features in one project.

Munch offers a streamlined way to create shareable content from existing videos, aimed at enhancing reach and engagement across various channels.

For anyone looking to repurpose content across platforms, this automation is a real time-saver. Munch‚Äôs formatting tools also make it easy to resize videos for different social platforms. The auto-cropping options adjust clips to fit Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and more, making cross-platform distribution simpler. I appreciated the automatic subtitle feature, which made my videos accessible to a broader audience without much additional work. However, while these features are useful, they lack some customization. I couldn‚Äôt manually adjust the selected clips as much as I‚Äôd like, and sometimes the AI would pick sections that didn‚Äôt feel as relevant or engaging as I had hoped. One limitation I noticed is that the output quality and customization options are fairly basic compared to more advanced editing software. While auto-cropping and subtitles are convenient, the styling options for subtitles are limited, and I missed having more flexibility with transitions and effects. This might be a drawback if you‚Äôre aiming for highly polished, branded content, as Munch is more focused on speed and efficiency than fine-tuning. Overall, though, it‚Äôs a solid tool for quickly repurposing long videos into social-friendly snippets. If you need a quick way to generate clips from existing content and don‚Äôt require advanced editing, Munch is a handy addition to your toolkit.

You spend hours trimming clips, syncing audio, and adjusting colors to get that perfect look. However, AI video creators and editors can handle the boring parts and give you more time to showcase creativity. Today, video editors are smarter than ever thanks to modern tools. From auto-captioning to object removal and even generating videos from scratch, AI video editing tools are changing the game. We tested several AI video editing apps over the past 2 weeks. Here are some of the best ones that we found useful. Table of Contents 1. Adobe Premiere Pro (Pro Video Editor with AI Features) 2. DaVinci Resolve (Free Hollywood-Grade Editing With AI Tools) 3. CapCut (Simple, Powerful Mobile AI Video Editor) 4. Opus Clip (Convert Long Videos to Short Clips) 5. Descript (Edit Videos Like a Text Document) 6. Runway (Collection of AI Tools) 7. ElevenLabs (Create ultra-realistic AI voiceovers) 8. HeyGen (Generate AI Avatars) 9. Sora by OpenAI (AI Video Generator) 1. Adobe Premiere Pro (Pro Video Editor with AI Features) Adobe Premiere Pro is a top-tier professional video editing software packed with various features that let you do everything from speed ramps to color grading. But it also has AI features to simplify and speed up your editing process. For example, it has Generative extend, which uses AI to add extra frames and extend clips smoothly. So you do not worry about awkward sudden cuts if you do not have the footage needed. You also get object addition and removal tools letting you seamlessly erase unwanted objects or insert new ones. Then there is Smart Masking, making it easy to track and edit moving objects. The platform also recently introduced Text-based editing, which lets edit clips like you are working with text. For audio, you have speech to text in over 18 languages and an AI Audio category tagging feature to automatically label audio as dialog, music, or effects. You can also enhance the audio using AI or auto-color to fix exposure and color balance. Basically a professional-level video editor with AI features sprinkled where you need them. However, it comes under an expensive subscription model that costs $22.99/month as a starting plan. Some of these AI models also run locally and require a high-end computer to take advantage of this completely. | Pros | Cons | | --- | --- | | Powerful AI tools for editing and audio | Expensive subscription model | | Text-based editing simplifies workflows | Steep learning curve for beginners | | Speech-to-text in multiple languages | Requires a high-end computer | | Object removal and smart masking features | Some AI tools are in beta and may be unstable | | Professional-grade color correction tools | Generative Extend limited to 1080p at 30 FPS | Pricing and Availability Premiere Pro Single App Plan: $22.99/month (100 GB cloud storage included) Creative Cloud All Apps Plan: $54.99/month (Includes over 20 Adobe apps) Student and Teacher Plan: $19.99/month (first year, then $34.99/month) Business Plan: $89.99/month per license (All apps + team features) Platform: Available on Windows and macOS Try Premiere Pro 2. DaVinci Resolve (Free Hollywood-Grade Editing With AI Tools) Looking for a professional-level video editor that‚Äôs also free? DaVinci Resolve is a solid choice. Just like Premiere Pro, it comes packed with AI video editing and enhancing tools to make your editing smoother and faster. Take IntelliTrack AI Tracking, for example. It uses the DaVinci Neural Engine to track objects and even create immersive audio panning based on movement. With Person Mask, you can automatically detect and track people for precise color grading or effects. Coming to audio, it has Music Remixer FX that can reshape your music track to fit the style you need. Can mute vocals, or specific instruments in the music using AI. DaVinci Resolve‚Äôs AI tools also speed up your workflow. Scene Cut Detection automatically detects parts that you may want to cut in the clips, saving you hours manually chopping unneeded parts. There‚Äôs even more like SuperScale for upscaling, Audio Ducker that lowers background music during dialog automatically, speech-to-text for captions, etc. | Pros | Cons | | --- | --- | | Powerful AI features in the free version | Limited collaboration in the free version | | Advanced color grading tools | Steep learning curve | | Lifetime license (one-time payment) | High-end hardware needed for smooth performance | | Accurate object and person tracking | Some advanced AI tools are Studio-only | | Social media-friendly auto-reframe | Limited collaboration in free version | Pricing and Availability DaVinci Resolve (Free): $0 ‚Äì Offers extensive editing tools and basic AI features. DaVinci Resolve Studio: $295 (one-time payment) ‚Äì Includes all advanced AI tools and premium features. Platform: Available on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Try Davinci Resolve 3. CapCut (Simple, Powerful Mobile AI Video Editor) If you want a simple mobile first AI-powered video editor, CapCut is the best option available. It started on Android and iPhone but then launched a desktop app. CapCut‚Äôs AI features cover everything from script creation to final edits. Script-to-Video turns your scripts into engaging videos with auto-generated visuals, while Text-to-Speech provides natural-sounding voiceovers in different styles. Need captions fast? Auto-Captions generate them instantly, making your videos more accessible. Plus, Background Removal lets you isolate subjects without a green screen, perfect for creative edits. CapCut also helps with platform-ready videos. Auto Reframe resizes your videos for social platforms like Instagram and TikTok. Need help with ideas? AI Writer generates scripts from prompts to kick-start your content. Want something unique? AI Character adds digital avatars that lip-sync to your audio. For smooth footage, AI Movement stabilizes shaky clips, giving your videos a polished look. It also has a free version that comes with basic AI tools like text-to-speech. To get all the tools CapCut can provide, you need a standard plan that costs $9.99/month. Currently, not available for new users, but existing users or downloading via third-party platforms like Softonic Works. | Pros | Cons | | --- | --- | | Strong AI tools even in free version | Advanced tools require Pro subscription | | Auto-captioning and text-to-speech | Performance issues on low-end devices | | Social-media-friendly auto-reframe | Several features moved behind paywalls | | Background removal without green screens | Risk of generic output from trendy filters | | Smooth AI-powered stabilization | U.S. app store ban affects availability | Pricing and Availability Free Version: Includes essential AI tools.

Opus Clip (Convert Long Videos to Short Clips) Already have a long video? With Opus Clip, you can turn long videos into short videos for platforms like TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels. It has AI-powered curation feature that can analyze videos to exact engaging highlight parts. It can also adjust the frame focusing on the main subject automatically. However, Opus Clip takes things one notch above for the short-form content. For example, it adds additional B-Roll with relevant visuals and adds animated captions with templates for better viewer engagement. Opus also offers a Virality Score, estimating each clip‚Äôs potential for social media success. Though it does not work as you expect, so take it with a pinch of salt. Also, it has a Social Post Scheduler feature allowing you to directly post on connected platforms making your short video generation process a lot easier. The only downside is, the free plan only comes with 60 minutes/month and has watermarks. The starter plan to remove this costs around $15/month. | Pros | Cons | | --- | --- | | Strong AI-powered editing tools | Free version has watermarks | | Auto-captioning with high accuracy | Some AI selections may lack context | | Virality score for social content | Limited uploads in free version | | Supports multiple platforms for sharing | Paid version is required for brand templates | | AI B-roll enhances storytelling | AI clip selection can be hit-or-miss | Pricing and Availability Free Plan: 60 minutes/month (Watermarked clips, basic tools) Starter Plan: $15/month ‚Äì 150 minutes, no watermarks, virality score Pro Plan: $29/month ‚Äì 500 minutes, multi-user support, AI B-roll Platforms: Web-based (No install needed) Global Availability: Accessible in 180+ countries Try Opus Clip 5. Descript (Edit Videos Like a Text Document) Descript makes video editing as simple as editing text. You can simply edit the transcript of the video and changes will be applied to the video. For example, when you remove the text from the transcript, that part of the video will be removed from the final video. You can also change the text or add any additional text to the transcript, it uses Voice Cloning to create your voice and add that to the video. It also has AI features to edit the transcript. For example, filler work removal feature cuts out words ‚Äòum‚Äô and ‚Äòuh‚Äô automatically. You can also generate scripts using AI. Also has various other AI features like Eye contact that adjusts your gaze direction to maintain engagement. With the free plan, you get 1 hour of transcription work. But for more AI features, you need a Hobbyist or Creator plan that costs $12 and $24 per month. | Pros | Cons | | --- | --- | | Simple text-based video and audio editing | Free plan has limited transcription hours | | AI-powered voice cloning with Overdub | Higher-tier plans are expensive | | Studio Sound for professional audio | Requires internet for cloud features | | Automatic filler word removal | Advanced AI tools are paywalled | | Built-in social content generators | Can feel complex for beginners | Pricing and Availability Free Plan: $0 ‚Äì 1 hour transcription, basic editing tools Hobbyist Plan: $12/month ‚Äì 10 hours of transcription, 1080p exports, basic AI tools Creator Plan: $24/month ‚Äì 30 hours transcription, 4K exports, advanced AI tools Business Plan: $40/month ‚Äì 40 hours of transcription, professional AI tools, team collaboration Platforms: macOS, Windows, and Web Try Descript 6.

ElevenLabs (Create ultra-realistic AI voiceovers) ElevenLabs is an audio-focused AI platform offering text-to-speech, voice changer, voice cloner, translate, and text-to-SFX features. The platform supports over 120+ voices across 29 languages. What makes ElevenLabs stand apart from similar tools is the quality of the audio generation especially in the Eleven V2 version. You can generate with either prompts or provide a complete script and convert the text into voice. However, the free plan only has limited credits useful for testing the platform.
