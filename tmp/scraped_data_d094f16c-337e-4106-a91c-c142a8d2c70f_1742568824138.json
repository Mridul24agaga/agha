With advancements in AI technology, businesses now have the opportunity to leverage AI generated video content to enhance their marketing strategies, increase customer engagement, and improve overall business performance. Understanding AI and Video Generation Before delving into the benefits of AI generated video for business, it is important to have a clear understanding of what AI is and how it is used in video production. Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. It involves the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and problem-solving. AI has revolutionized various industries, including video production. With the advancements in AI technology, video generation using AI has become a powerful tool for businesses to create engaging and customized video content. At Snapbar, we're harnessing AI video generation to produce truly unique, short video outputs based on individual users with Snapshot AI - our AI Photo Booth. Our clients will now be able to incorporate their brand, event, or messaging into these custom-designed, automatically generated videos that are all based around the user and the pictures that they capture or upload during the process. What is AI? AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include understanding natural language, recognizing objects and patterns, making decisions, and learning from experience. AI technology has evolved over the years, with various subfields emerging, such as machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. These subfields enable machines to process and analyze vast amounts of data, learn from it, and make informed decisions or predictions. In the context of video generation, AI algorithms are trained with large volumes of data to learn and replicate human-like video content creation. This involves feeding the algorithms with various inputs, such as images, videos, and scripts, which they use to generate new video content based on learned patterns and preferences. Source: Medium.com The Process of Video Generation Using AI Video generation using AI involves a complex process that combines data analysis, machine learning, and creative content creation. The process begins with collecting and preprocessing a vast amount of data, including images, videos, and scripts. Once the data is collected, it is fed into AI algorithms, which are trained to analyze and understand the patterns and features within the data. This training process allows the algorithms to learn the visual elements, storytelling techniques, and other creative aspects of video production. After the training process, the AI algorithms are capable of generating new video content based on the learned patterns and preferences. This AI-generated video content can be customized to suit specific business requirements and can be used for a range of purposes, including marketing campaigns, product demonstrations, training videos, and more. The use of AI in video generation offers several advantages for businesses. It allows for faster and more cost-effective video production, as AI algorithms can generate content at a much faster pace than human editors. Additionally, AI-generated videos can be easily customized to target specific audiences and can incorporate personalized elements, such as logos, branding, and messages. Furthermore, AI-generated videos can be optimized for different platforms and devices, ensuring that the content is displayed correctly and effectively across various channels, including websites, social media platforms, and mobile devices. The Role of AI in Video Production AI technology plays a significant role in video production by enhancing video quality and speeding up the production process. But what exactly does this mean for businesses and content creators? Enhancing Video Quality with AI AI algorithms can analyze and enhance video content by automatically adjusting lighting, color, and other elements to create visually appealing videos. This ensures that businesses can produce high-quality videos that captivate and engage their target audience. Imagine a scenario where a company wants to create a promotional video for their new product. With AI technology, they can ensure that the video is visually stunning and attention-grabbing. The AI algorithms analyze the footage and make precise adjustments to the lighting, ensuring that the product is showcased in the best possible way. Colors are enhanced to make the video more vibrant and appealing, creating a visual experience that leaves a lasting impression on viewers. Furthermore, AI can also assist in optimizing video resolution. By analyzing the content, AI algorithms can upscale the video to higher resolutions, enhancing the overall viewing experience. This is particularly useful for businesses that want to create videos for large screens or high-resolution displays. Speeding Up the Video Production Process Traditionally, video production involves time-consuming tasks such as filming, editing, and post-production. However, with the advent of AI-generated video content, this process has been revolutionized, saving businesses valuable time and resources. While we're focused on the benefits and positive aspects of the technology here, it's important to note there is also a lot of controversy around ethical usage, jobs being replaced, and widespread adoption without oversight. We'll leave it at that for this article. Ok, let's take a closer look at how AI speeds up the video production process. Imagine a content creator who wants to produce a series of tutorial videos for their online platform. In the past, they would have to spend hours editing each video, cutting out mistakes, and adding visual effects. With AI, this process becomes much more efficient. AI algorithms can automatically edit videos, removing unnecessary footage, and even adding transitions and effects to enhance the overall production value. This not only saves time but also ensures a consistent and professional look across all videos in the series. Content creators can focus on the creative aspects of video production, while AI takes care of the technical details. Moreover, AI can assist in automating other aspects of video production, such as voiceover generation and captioning. By analyzing the video content, AI algorithms can generate realistic and natural-sounding voiceovers, eliminating the need for hiring voice actors. Additionally, AI can automatically generate captions for videos, making them more accessible to a wider audience. In conclusion, AI technology has revolutionized the world of video production. It enhances video quality by automatically adjusting various elements, creating visually stunning videos that captivate viewers. Moreover, it speeds up the production process by automating tasks such as video editing, saving businesses valuable time and resources. As AI continues to advance, we can expect even more exciting developments in the field of video production. Benefits of Using AI Generated Video for Business The use of AI generated video offers several benefits for businesses of all sizes. In addition to the advantages mentioned, there are other compelling reasons why companies should consider incorporating AI-generated videos into their marketing strategies. Cost-Effective Video Production AI-generated video content reduces the need for extensive manual labor and expensive resources, making it a cost-effective solution for businesses. By leveraging AI technology, companies can streamline their video production process and save both time and money. Traditional video production methods often require a team of professionals, including scriptwriters, actors, directors, and editors, which can be costly. With AI, companies can create high-quality videos at a fraction of the cost compared to traditional methods. AI can also automate various aspects of video production, such as video editing, which can significantly reduce the time and effort required to produce a polished final product. This allows businesses to allocate their resources more efficiently and focus on other critical areas of their operations. Creating Personalized Video Content Personalization is key to effective marketing, and AI-generated videos can be customized to cater to individual customer preferences. By analyzing customer data and behavior, businesses can create personalized video content that resonates with their target audience, resulting in higher engagement and better conversion rates. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data, such as browsing history, purchase patterns, and social media interactions, to understand each customer's unique preferences and interests. With this information, businesses can tailor their video content to deliver personalized messages, product recommendations, and offers that are more likely to capture the attention of their customers. Additionally, AI can dynamically adapt video content in real-time based on user interactions. For example, an AI-generated video advertisement can adjust its narrative or showcase different product features based on the viewer's responses or actions. This level of personalization enhances the viewer's experience and increases the chances of conversion. Utilizing Snapshot AI, brands can not only create super unique video outputs that have been engineered for their brand or event, but have the video entirely based on the end user. It's the future of the photo booth! ‍ Scaling Video Production with AI With AI-generated videos, businesses can scale their video production efforts without compromising quality. AI algorithms can quickly generate multiple variations of the same video content, allowing businesses to cater to different market segments and increase their reach. Traditionally, creating a video for each specific market segment would require significant time and resources. However, AI-powered video generation can automate the process of creating customized videos by adapting the content, visuals, and messaging to suit different demographics, locations, or preferences. This scalability enables businesses to target a broader audience and maximize the impact of their video marketing campaigns. Additionally, AI can analyze the performance of different video variations and provide insights on which versions are most effective in driving engagement and conversions. This data-driven approach allows businesses to refine their video content continuously and optimize their marketing strategies for better results. In conclusion, AI-generated videos offer numerous benefits for businesses, including cost-effectiveness, personalized content creation, and scalable production. By embracing AI technology, companies can unlock new possibilities in video marketing and gain a competitive edge in today's digital landscape. Real-World Examples of AI Generated Video in Business Several industries have already embraced the use of AI-generated videos to enhance their business operations and marketing campaigns. The applications of AI-generated videos are vast and diverse, providing businesses with innovative ways to connect with their target audience. One compelling case study showcasing the power of AI in advertising involves advertising agencies utilizing AI-generated videos to create targeted advertisements that resonate with specific customer segments. By analyzing customer data, AI algorithms can generate videos that align with consumer preferences, resulting in highly effective ad campaigns and increased brand awareness. These AI-generated videos are not only visually appealing but also tailored to capture the attention of the intended audience, leading to higher engagement and conversion rates. In the realm of e-commerce, AI-generated videos have revolutionized the way businesses showcase their products. E-commerce platforms have integrated AI-generated videos to enhance product visuals, provide virtual product demonstrations, and deliver personalized shopping experiences. By leveraging AI technology, businesses can create dynamic videos that highlight the unique features and benefits of their products. These videos offer customers a more immersive and interactive shopping experience, allowing them to visualize and understand the product's value proposition more effectively. This, in turn, leads to increased customer satisfaction and higher conversion rates. ‍ Moreover, AI-generated videos have the potential to transform customer support and service. By using AI algorithms, businesses can create instructional videos that guide customers through troubleshooting processes or provide step-by-step tutorials on product usage. These videos not only reduce the need for extensive customer support but also empower customers to resolve their issues independently. As a result, businesses can save time and resources while enhancing customer satisfaction. Another significant application of AI-generated videos is in the field of education and training. Educational institutions and organizations can utilize AI technology to create engaging and interactive educational videos. These videos can cater to different learning styles and adapt to individual student needs, providing a personalized learning experience. AI-generated videos can present complex concepts in a simplified manner, making them more accessible and comprehensible for learners of all ages. ‍ As the news has been reporting about heavily due to multiple industry-wide strikes, AI-generated videos have also found their way into the entertainment industry. Movie production companies are incorporating AI technology to generate realistic visual effects and create lifelike characters. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data to generate high-quality graphics and animations, enhancing the overall cinematic experience for viewers. It's clear that AI-generated videos have become a game-changer for businesses across various industries. From advertising to e-commerce, customer support to education, and even entertainment, AI technology is reshaping the way businesses communicate and engage with their audience. As the capabilities of AI continue to evolve, we can expect even more exciting and innovative applications of AI-generated videos in the future. Potential Challenges and Solutions in Implementing AI Video Generation While AI-generated video offers numerous benefits, there are also challenges that businesses may face when implementing this technology. Addressing Data Privacy Concerns Privacy concerns surrounding the use of customer data for AI-generated videos are a valid consideration. Businesses must ensure they have robust data privacy policies in place and adhere to legal regulations pertaining to data protection. This includes obtaining proper consent from customers for the use of their data and implementing secure storage and encryption measures to safeguard sensitive information, as well as strengthening security and protection systems by using sustainable data centers to ensure the proper and constant functioning of servers. In addition, businesses can explore the use of privacy-enhancing technologies such as differential privacy, which adds a layer of protection by injecting noise into the data used for AI video generation. This helps to protect individual privacy while still allowing for effective video creation. Overcoming Technical Barriers Implementing AI-generated video production may require technical expertise and investment in AI infrastructure. However, with advancements in AI technology, there are now user-friendly platforms and tools available that simplify the process and make it accessible to businesses of all sizes. For businesses that lack in-house technical expertise, partnering with AI service providers can be a viable solution. These providers offer ready-to-use AI video generation solutions, allowing businesses to leverage the technology without the need for extensive technical knowledge. This not only reduces the barrier to entry but also enables businesses to focus on their core competencies while still benefiting from AI-generated video content. Furthermore, cloud-based AI platforms provide scalability and flexibility, allowing businesses to easily scale their video production capabilities as their needs grow. This eliminates the need for significant upfront investments in infrastructure and provides businesses with the agility to adapt to changing market demands. Another technical challenge that businesses may face is the need for high-quality training data. AI models require large amounts of diverse and labeled data to effectively generate videos. To overcome this challenge, businesses can leverage crowdsourcing platforms or collaborate with external data providers to acquire the necessary training data. Additionally, data augmentation techniques, such as image and video synthesis, can be employed to expand the available training data and improve the performance of AI models. As AI continues to evolve, the future of video production for business looks promising, with endless possibilities for creativity and marketing success.

With the emergence of ChatGPT and DALL-E 2 in recent times, the conversation around AI and ML (machine learning) applications has reached a crescendo. Benefits Of Generative AI In Marketing As a marketer that is always looking to maximize ROI and experiment with the latest technology, I, like many of us, have tested and used generative AI. Some of its immediate benefits include saving time, personalizing content and helping to create content. For example, AI and ML are being increasingly used in marketing to provide faster replies to customers than humans. We see this example in chatbots and other search capabilities. Marketers are also using this technology to evaluate and summarize online information, automate content generation and speed up the writing process. Furthermore, generative AI can analyze data and identify consumer behavior patterns to help marketers create appealing content that resonates with their audience. For example, a marketer could use generative AI to suggest news stories or best practices based on content that the user had previously engaged. 5 Generative AI Use Cases For Marketing Generative AI has multiple use cases across different industry verticals and, in marketing especially, can enable brands to accelerate the delivery of personalized marketing content while adhering to the brand's writing style and tone. 1. Text or Content Generation Text generative AI uses natural language processing algorithms and large language models to automate content creation. These models work with large data sets of existing content examples to analyze the pattern and styles of compelling content. In addition to generating unique ideas, AI-generated text can be used for different content creation purposes including: • Creating content for marketing in the form of emails, social media or blog posts. • Scriptwriting and storytelling for videos and advertisements. • Generating clear, concise and engaging product descriptions. 2. Image and Video Generation Generative AI can automate image generation with deep learning algorithms and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Image generation through these tools can be implemented in marketing in several ways, including: • Creating highly realistic images of products for use in online stores, social media channels and other marketing materials. • Developing visual branding of materials like logos. • Crafting advertising that is engaging and visually appealing. Also, generative AI video tools can help create high-quality marketing videos and product demo videos, which can help increase brand awareness and facilitate conversions. 3. Marketing Automation and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Generative AI analyzes large amounts of data and can identify consumer behavior patterns to help businesses identify SEO-friendly, relevant, high-performing keywords and phrases for their digital marketing campaigns. In helping to build SEO content, marketers can use generative AI tools for: • Discovering content topic ideas. • Conducting keyword research. • Finding relevant content titles. • Grouping search intent. • Creating content structure. 4. Customer Service You can automate the customer service model with artificial intelligence, as conversational AI models have proven they can quickly understand customer queries and respond to them faster than humans. Generative AI is automating customer service tasks today via: • Chatbots and messaging apps that can offer customer service channels 24/7. • Email automation that provides fast responses to common customer queries and requests. • Self-service portals that have embedded generative AI capabilities that offer personalized recommendations and solutions to clients depending on their queries and history. • Multilingual support and localization, thus, catering to a large cross-section of society. 5. Enabling a Cookieless Future Cookieless marketing is the future as platforms like Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox and even Apple are phasing out third-party cookies. Marketing professionals might feel that these new restrictions can diminish the performance of their targeted ads. But rest assured, generative AI can even help in this use case. Generative AI helps with code generation based on natural language input. The benefits include saving programmers and software developers from laborious tasks like code optimization, bug detection and code completion such that they can focus on tasks that require human intervention. Concerns About Using Generative AI There is no question that AI is bringing a revolution to the marketing domain. However, certain risks and pitfalls remain. Machine-generated content still lacks the emotional intelligence that comes with human creativity. As such, it can mute the personality of a brand, which, in turn, can negatively impact customer loyalty, engagement and brand perception. Additionally, generative AI can quickly create highly targeted content but may not always provide the best or most accurate outcome. Sometimes, AI algorithms make decisions depending on incomplete or inaccurate information leading to poor quality or offensive content. Marketers can defuse this problem in part by using tools that are regularly tested and updated with current data. But the bottom line is that marketers must understand that generative AI can help automate specific aspects of their campaigns, but it cannot replace the creativity or emotional connections they use in crafting compelling campaigns. Getting Started With Your Generative AI Journey As technology evolves, AI will take on more prominent roles across marketing, fueling more innovation and growth. To get started, first define your objectives and determine what areas of your marketing strategy can benefit from AI. Identify the proper use cases where generative AI can improve the efficiency of your marketing programs. Next, make sure to use quality data inputs as AI depends on it to generate valuable insights and accurate predictions. Last, start with small and manageable marketing projects and iterate as you learn and gain experience in using AI in the marketing domain. The key to success is to start small, iterate and continuously improve.

Generative AI (gen AI) in marketing refers to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, specifically those that can create new content, insights and solutions, to enhance marketing efforts. These generative AI tools use advanced machine learning models to analyze large datasets and generate outputs that mimic human reasoning and decision-making. This capability allows marketers to automate, personalize and innovate on their marketing strategies in various ways. For example, they can create personalized content for individual consumers or surface recommendations to marketing departments based on vast troves of customer data. Over the last decade, e-commerce companies and other organizations have deployed AI for various marketing applications, including A/B testing advertisements and automating marketing campaign staples such as email blasts. But with the emergent sophistication of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, new technologies are poised to upend digital marketing. These advancements have produced significant innovations in AI marketing over a short period of time. Recently, the automotive company Carvana created 1.3 million unique AI-generated videos1 tailored to individual customer journeys. Spotify experimented with automatic podcast translation, potentially reaching new markets and target audiences.2 For marketing departments, generative AI can automate repetitive tasks such as writing product descriptions or summarizing customer feedback, freeing up human workers for more critical and valuable tasks. As AI models capable of deep learning become more familiar with a brand’s voice, product offerings and customers, their outputs improve and overall performance increases. Innovations such as these vastly increased interest in using generative AI for marketing in recent years. According to an IBM survey in partnership with Momentive.ai, 67% of CMOs reported they planned on implementing generative AI in the next 12 months. As many as 86% planned to do so within 24 months. Yet for many companies, current generative AI initiatives remain focused on using the technology for efficiency and cost reduction rather than innovation and growth.3 ![Image 1: 3D design of balls rolling on a track](https://www.ibm.com/content/dam/connectedassets-adobe-cms/worldwide-content/pm/ul/g/5a/6e/trailv2_1200x1200.component.think-ad-xl.ts=1738593304323.jpeg/content/experience-fragments/adobe-cms/us/en/site-v2/think-hub/article/_8_column_general_ad/blueprint---think-ad---xf---do-not-modify/artificialintelligence-article-newsletter/_jcr_content/root/think_ad_copy/image) The latest AI News + Insights Discover expertly curated insights and news on AI, cloud and more in the weekly Think Newsletter. Subscribe today How does generative AI in marketing work? Generative AI models use machine learning techniques to generate text, images, audio and video. These models are trained on vast datasets, learning patterns and structures within the data to produce outputs that mimic human decision-making. In marketing applications, generative AI is often used in tandem with traditional AI to drive efficiency. To take a simple example, generative AI might create advertising copy and imagery, while machine learning determines which customers receive a particular creative asset. While OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Dall-E remain some of the most publicly recognized models, increasingly leading-edge organizations are creating customized or semicustomized generative AI solutions trained on brand-specific or task-specific datasets. For example, IBM’s granite library of foundation models are trained on enterprise data from the legal, academic and financial sectors to best suit business applications. Using enterprise-oriented models such as these, an organization can layer its own data—for instance, historical information about customer interactions—over a foundation model. This process creates a more specific and effective series of AI tools. As these technologies “learn” over time, purpose-built AI models trained to complete specific tasks can continually improve and develop more capacity for specific tasks. Marketing departments are well-positioned to take advantage of this technology, as customer communication and advertising generate vast amounts of data. Generative AI is particularly adept at analyzing unstructured data such as social media posts or chat communications. Organizations might choose to integrate these tools in assorted ways, with varying degrees of human interaction and business-wide impact. While in recent years, prebuilt generative AI solutions have become nearly ubiquitous in marketing departments large and small, organizations are increasingly embracing custom models and large-scale digital transformations driven by AI. According to a recent report from the IBM® Institute for Business Value, more than half of CMOs say they are planning to build foundation models based on their company’s proprietary data. Broadly, the degree to which a business adopts AI can be divided into three categories: Prebuilt generative AI models Customized generative AI models Large-scale AI transformation Prebuilt generative AI models Increasingly, individual content creators and marketing professionals use prebuilt models such as ChatGPT to generate ideas and create first drafts of customer communications. Similarly, off-the-shelf generative AI-enabled marketing tools such as Adobe’s Generative Fill allow individuals to quickly alter creative assets by using natural language prompts. These AI solutions, built with versatility in mind and aimed at large audiences, increase day-to-day efficiency by decreasing the time employees spend on routine tasks. Customized generative AI models Some organizations opt to lightly customize foundation models, training them on brand-specific proprietary information for specific use cases. This might include generating creative assets, recommending search engine optimization (SEO) keywords or analyzing data to forecast future customer behavior. Using these models, humans receive content from a generative AI technology and approve or take advantage of its input. Large-scale AI transformation A large-scale AI transformation combines multiple AI technologies, including customized generative AI solutions, to alter an organization’s core marketing processes. In addition to using models trained on proprietary data to increase efficiency and embedding key automations, this kind of transformative AI practice might generate entirely new ways of marketing. For example, by using generative AI to analyze consumer sentiment and develop new products or provide autonomous guidance to customers as they shop.

Watch the latest podcast episodes Use cases for generative AI in marketing Generative AI uses a combination of advanced technologies to create, personalize and optimize content and customer interactions. Some common use cases include: Chatbots and customer experience Text generation and image generation Personalization and segmentation Data analysis and predictive analysis Process automation Idea generation Chatbots and customer experience Generative AI enhances customer interaction by providing instant, intelligent responses and support across various touchpoints. This might include an AI chatbot handling potential customer inquiries, providing product information and ushering consumers through a sale—all in natural, intuitive language. AI-driven virtual assistants also guide users through websites, recommend purchases and improve the overall user experience. For instance, generative AI customer interaction tools might automatically respond to customer reviews and complaints in a brand’s voice, summarizing potential issues for an organization’s customer support team. Generative AI might even automate future discounts or product replacements. Chatbots and virtual agents trained on an organization’s proprietary data provide round-the-clock assistance and global reach across time zones. Combined with Robotic Process Automation (RPA), they can trigger specific actions, such as initiating a sale or return process, without human intervention. As these generative AI tools “remember” interactions with customers, they can nurture leads over long periods, maintaining a cohesive relationship with an individual consumer. These highly personalized experiences engender loyalty and increase conversion rates. Generative AI chatbots also collect crucial information for marketers about consumer preferences and behavior. They can analyze this vast and invaluable dataset to make recommendations and improve operations across a business. Text generation and image generation Generative AI revolutionizes the content supply chain from end-to-end by automating and optimizing the creation, distribution and management of marketing content. Applications for AI in content marketing include automated content creation. Through these processes, AI tools generate high-quality blog posts, social media updates and ad copy based on specific keywords, topics and styles. Generative AI also creates custom images and video tailored to brand aesthetics and campaign needs, enhancing visual content without the need for extensive design resources. These models also significantly accelerate the creative production process, allowing marketing professionals to rapidly create and test various creative assets, creating fully fledged campaigns in a matter of hours or days. Personalization and segmentation Where traditional AI might have helped marketing professionals segment audiences into broad groups according to purchasing history or taste, generative AI has ushered in an era of micro-segmentation. Micro-segmentation gives organizations the power to market to specific individuals in close to real-time. This type of personalization is a key strength of generative AI, allowing marketers to deliver highly targeted and relevant experiences to consumers at scale across channels. For instance, generative AI might create customized recipes and meal-planning ideas based on customer grocery orders, or interpret an individual’s feedback to generate product recommendations. Generative AI also enhances adaptive content, in which websites, emails and mobile apps adjust their displays in real-time based on individual user interactions and data, creating the most relevant possible experience for consumers. An AI tool trained on a brand’s specific messaging can craft individual creative assets for small audience segments, helping ensure marketing communications resonate as effectively as possible with diverse customer groups. Data analysis and predictive analytics Generative AI excels at analyzing vast amounts of data to uncover customer insights and predict future trends, enabling data-driven decision-making. This might include market research analysis, a process through which AI algorithms interpret market data or competitor pricing to identify future consumer behavior and broader industry dynamics. Other generative AI tools might use customer data to surface and target particularly relevant audiences. Using the technology, organizations can quickly and efficiently identify the best possible leads and predict future trends, helping marketers plan proactive campaigns and optimize their resources. Process automation Generative AI streamlines marketing processes using automation. By automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks, organizations can achieve increased efficiency and productivity. Some AI-powered tools can automate various marketing workflows such as social media posting or email sequencing, freeing up human resources for more strategic initiatives. Some are used to manage specific marketing campaigns, monitor campaign data and optimize the delivery of advertisements or communications based on performance. Generative AI is also used to translate content from one language to another, or convert files into several formats, streamlining marketing departments’ day-to-day operations and increasing a brand's reach. The technology can also optimize the creative production process. Using generative AI, marketing departments can rapidly generate dozens of versions of a piece of content and then A/B test that content to automatically determine the most effective variation of an ad. Idea generation Generative AI can stimulate creativity and innovation by generating new ideas and content variations. Marketing departments might use generative AI to suggest search engine optimization (SEO) headlines or topics based on current trends and audience interests. For example, according to the consultancy McKinsey, Kellogg’s uses AI technologies to scan viral recipes that incorporate breakfast cereal. Generative AI then uses that data to create creative assets and social media posts.4 During the ideation process, generative AI can also be used to suggest options for logos or advertisements, providing a vast trove of ideas for marketing departments to choose from and refine. Benefits of generative AI in marketing Generative AI offers various ways to optimize business processes and increase customer engagement, transforming the scale at which marketing departments communicate with and learn from consumers. Some key advantages to using generative AI in marketing include: Increased efficiency through automation Hyper-personalized marketing Scaleability Cost-effectiveness Data-driven decision-making Improved customer experience Real-time adaption Increased efficiency through automation Generative AI automates the creation of content such as social media posts and ad copy, significantly reducing the time and effort required from marketing teams. AI-powered virtual agents or chatbots communicating in natural language also provide constant, 24-hour customer support with minimal human intervention. Hyper-personalized marketing Generative AI delivers personalized messages, recommendations and offers based on individual customer data and behavior. This enhances the relevance and impact of marketing efforts and increases brand awareness. Scalability Generative AI easily handles large volumes of customer interactions or content creation needs, accommodating growing audiences.

They also forecast future trends and customer needs, helping marketers to anticipate and respond proactively. Improved customer experience AI marketing tools assist with content generation, creating more engaging experiences for customers and increasing conversion rates. Generative AI across multiple platforms also creates consistent, yet unique, brand messaging across multiple channels and touchpoints. Real-time adaption Generative AI allows organizations to quickly respond to customer feedback and interactions, refining campaigns for better outcomes. Steps to implementing generative AI in marketing While every generative AI implementation is dependent on an organization’s capacity and goals, some common steps to implement generative AI for marketing include: Defining customer experience goals Collecting and analyzing data Choosing generative AI tools Integrating and deploying generative AI Monitoring and improving generative AI 1. Defining customer experience goals Typically, decision-makers spend significant time outlining their organization’s goals before designing an AI implementation. This might include auditing existing processes that might benefit from enhancement, identifying workflows that might benefit from generative AI and outlining the wanted customer experience. 2. Collecting and analyzing data During this phase, an organization typically gathers data from various customer touchpoints to understand their preferences, behavior and data points. A business might also collect and clean internal proprietary data, or engage trusted third-party data to create a cohesive dataset on which to train an AI. 3. Choosing generative AI tools Depending on the scope of the AI implementation, an organization might decide on a prebuilt tool or identify what kind of model it will use to train a bespoke AI during this phase. Regardless of how customized the eventual solution will be, organizations generally research options thoroughly before coming to a decision. 4. Integrating and deploying generative AI Integrations might take as little as a few weeks or a year. Large-scale AI transformations might require additional infrastructure and talent, while prebuilt off-the-shelf models might simply dictate that marketing departments input datasets they’ve previously identified. During the training and tuning period, the AI tool learns from third-party and internal data to function more effectively. 5. Monitoring and improving generative AI Typically, an organization consistently reviews its generative AI tools to identify areas for improvement and continuously feeds the AI new data to improve accuracy. Best practices when implementing generative AI in marketing While the use of generative AI offers numerous advantages for marketing departments, it also presents some challenges organizations typically navigate to effectively implement and benefit from the technology. Some of those challenges and potential solutions include: Data quality and availability Data privacy and user trust Quality control and consistency across AI models and outputs Data quality and availability Generative AI models require a huge amount of high-quality data to function effectively. Inaccurate data or data with bias can lead to poor performance and unreliable outputs. Also, gathering and managing the necessary data can be time-consuming and costly, especially for smaller businesses with limited resources. Organizations embarking on a generative AI project might hire additional data scientists and data engineers to help ensure the quality and consistency of a training corpus or engage a trusted third party with vetted data practices. Data privacy and user trust Using customer data for AI-driven personalization and content creation typically requires organizations to keep a close eye on data privacy rules and regulations. As mishandling data can lead to compliance issues and a loss of consumer trust, an organization might need to invest in advanced security infrastructure. Successful generative AI solutions are typically transparent and explainable, meaning the business designing the AI has clear documentation about how it was trained and tuned. Additionally, an organization using proprietary or user data might carefully design the AI tools with the customer’s level of comfort in mind, helping ensure customer experience solutions don’t appear invasive. Quality control and consistency across AI models and outputs Ensuring that AI-generated content meets brand standards and maintains a consistent voice can be challenging. Choosing the right model and thoroughly auditing training data can be time-consuming. In the initial planning phase, an organization typically researches specific foundation models extensively, ensuring the basis of its AI solutions is the most appropriate to deploy for a specific use case. To ensure consistency over the long term, organizations typically monitor a model continuously to detect and correct errors. They might also feed a model more data to make sure it’s up-to-date.

This has increased engagement and conversions over 10% per McKinsey research. Personalized subject lines: Insider‘s AI platform generates email subject lines adapted to customer history, increasing open rates by up to 40% compared to generalized subject lines. Real-time offers: Brands like Levi‘s tailor web experiences using AI, offering promotional discounts or prompt shipping incentives based on real-time shopping behavior. The ability to hyper-personalize CX provides immense value. With generative AI, delivering the right message or experience to the right customer at the right time scales perfectly. 3. Boosted Creativity and Innovation While AI excels at automating tasks, it can also foster human creativity in marketing. By rapidly testing creative concepts and generating novel ideas, generative AI augments marketers‘ imagination. According to an Adobe survey, 77% of marketers believe AI assists them in conceptualizing and brainstorming. Key ways generative AI spurs creativity and innovation include: Brainstorming support: Marketing teams use conversational AI tools like ChatGPT to expand on early ideas for campaigns, content themes, partnerships, and more. This provides a jumpstart for creative processes. Data-driven insights: By analyzing customer data, past campaigns, and market trends, generative AI identifies hidden patterns and opportunities. This powers data-backed creativity. Fresh perspectives: Processing huge datasets enables generative AI to make unexpected connections and approach problems from new angles. DALL-E even creates visual art reflecting novel concepts. Rapid prototyping: Brands like BMW use AI to quickly generate design prototypes customized to different vehicles. Rapid iteration allows efficiently testing and selecting creative concepts. While AI won‘t replace human creativity any time soon, generative AI gives marketers superpowers for ideation, creation, and innovation. This unique combination of AI and human ingenuity will dominate marketing in the years ahead. Now that we‘ve covered the key benefits, let‘s look at 7 real-world applications of generative AI across marketing. 7 Use Cases of Generative AI in Marketing Here are 7 areas where leading brands already use generative AI to get results: AI-generated text AI-generated images AI-generated video AI-generated music Conversational AI for customer service Sentiment analysis SEO content optimization I‘ll walk through examples of brands implementing generative AI for each of these critical functions. 1.

Powerful generative image models like DALL-E 2 enable creating photorealistic visuals straight from text prompts. Brands can quickly iterate visual concepts without costly photography. According to a SurveyMonkey study, 72% of marketers believe AI-generated images will be very useful for creating ads, social posts, and other visual assets. As the technology keeps advancing, adoption will continue growing. Figure 2. Example of an AI-generated advertisement for a new electric car model using ChatGPT. 3. AI-Generated Video Video reigns supreme in digital advertising and content today. Producing quality video at scale remains challenging for human creators. This is where generative AI delivers transformative potential. Possible applications of AI-generated video include: Personalized and dynamic video ads Animated explainers and tutorials Product concept prototypes and demos Custom social videos tailored to each platform Typography and motion graphics for branding Synthetic talking heads and spokespeople For example, Nestlé partnered with Google to promote its candy brand KitKat using AI-generated videos tailored to Christmas themes. By generating dynamic video content programmatically, they created a highly customized campaign. Using platforms like Runway, brands can turn text prompts into video complete with synthesized voiceovers. This allows rapidly iterating video ad concepts before filming anything. According to Insider Intelligence, personalized video ad spending is growing at a 24% CAGR, making AI synthesis essential for scaling. Over 65% of firms are currently piloting AI for automated video creation. However, generative video poses risks of deception through techniques like deepfakes. Responsible branding requires ethics policies and transparency around synthetic media. 4. AI-Generated Music Music and audio are often overlooked in marketing. Original compositions and sound design greatly enhance the impact of video, podcasts, and other audio content. AI-generated music provides a solution. Using generative music tools like Aiva or Boomy, brands can automatically create: Sonic branding elements and audio logos Background music and scores for advertising Custom sound effects for branded content Theme songs and jingles optimized for campaigns Synthetic voiceovers tailored to desired moods For example, the NBA team Sacramento Kings uses AI to generate personalized music for player introductions matching the energy of the crowd, similar to how gun sound effects might be used to heighten intensity in action scenes. This creates a unique audio experience for fans. Endel and other generative music startups have partnered with brands like Lincoln and Ralph Lauren to create branded soundscapes tuned to their target audiences. As streaming becomes consumers‘ #1 media activity, original audio content is a huge opportunity. AI-generated music provides unlimited, customized compositions to make marketing resonate. 5. Conversational AI for Customer Service Customer service and conversational marketing are becoming inextricably linked. Chatbots and messaging enable brands to engage audiences and nurture relationships. Key capabilities of conversational AI in marketing include: 24/7 automated availability Instantly resolving common questions Seamless scaling for mass inquiries Accessing customer data and order history Providing personalized cross-selling offers Collecting customer feedback and reviews For example, Sephora uses a conversational AI-powered chatbot to provide personalized skincare recommendations. Users are asked about their skin type and concerns, then served product suggestions suited to their needs. This bot has increased conversions over 75% compared to generic bots. Leading conversational AI platforms like Intercom, Ada, and Drift integrate capabilities like chatbots, messaging, and live support to optimize CX across touchpoints. According to Salesforce research, 69% of consumers expect companies to respond and interact within real time via messaging. Smart use of conversational AI delivers on these service expectations. 6. Sentiment Analysis Understanding how audiences feel about a brand provides powerful consumer insights to guide strategy. AI sentiment analysis examines customer conversations across channels to detect associated emotions and pain points. Key marketing applications of sentiment analysis include: Monitoring customer feedback at scale across touchpoints Pinpointing dissatisfied audience segments Identifying reasons for brand reputation declines Optimizing customer journeys based on emotional cues Personalizing support and communication based on sentiment For example, brands can apply sentiment analysis to customer support conversations to identify key pain points and opportunities to improve products or services. One telecom provider used AI sentiment analysis to find their app‘s slow loading times led to widespread user frustration. By optimizing app performance, they improved satisfaction and loyalty. According to Predictive Analytics Today, brands using AI sentiment analysis achieve customer satisfaction scores over 20% higher on average than those who don‘t. Advanced sentiment analysis platforms like Haptik combine natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and human-in-the-loop training to accurately interpret nuanced conversations. This produces granular emotional insights. 7. SEO Content Optimization Search engine optimization (SEO) ensures brands rank prominently in organic search results. Generative AI can create optimized, high-value web content tailored to target keywords. Specific applications of generative AI for marketing SEO include: Conducting on-page keyword research Optimizing page titles, headers, and metadata Improving overall content structure and outlines Generating blog topics optimized for search performance Repurposing and expanding existing content Automating link building For example, the growth marketing teams at Anthropic use ChatGPT to perform preliminary keyword research and suggest high-potential topics to create content around. Tools like Copysmith analyze existing web pages then generate additional optimized content and links to boost SEO authority. This streamlines localization and optimization at scale. According to recent surveys, 75% of digital marketers already use or plan to soon use AI for content optimization. The demand for solutions that amplify online visibility and traffic continues growing exponentially. Realize the Potential of AI-Powered Marketing As this guide illustrates, generative AI unlocks game-changing potential across all facets of marketing. By embracing AI tools for content creation, customer engagement, and data-driven insights, brands can gain a systematic edge. The examples and data presented demonstrate how generative AI drives transformative efficiency through automation, hyper-personalization at scale, and enhanced human creativity. Leading organizations are already realizing tremendous value using generative AI for marketing. With responsible implementation, your brand can also leverage AI to work smarter, foster innovation, and deepen customer connections.

Load More Results Home Marketing Disruptive AI Video Trends that are Transforming Marketing in 2024 Disruptive AI Video Trends that are Transforming Marketing in 2024 Written by: Kipp Bodnar and Kieran Flanagan THE STATE OF AI IN 2024 New research into how marketers are using AI and key insights into the future of marketing with AI. Download the Free Report Updated: 08/01/24 Published: 07/23/24 AI-generated video content is turning the marketing world on its head. But what trends should marketers be focusing on to stay ahead of the competition? If you've been following the latest buzz in AI marketing trends — and you should be — you know that AI video tools are at the forefront of this change. Whether it’s trained ad avatars or hyper-personalized video scripts, these technologies are irreversibly changing how we create content and engage with our audiences. But with such rapid innovation, what’s actually worth the hype? Kieran and I experimented with some of these new developments in a recent episode of Marketing Against the Grain, including a viral AI video on Twitter and an AI-generated ad created in less than 15 minutes. Among the many AI video options available, these four trends have been particularly notable — and are worth paying close attention to. Free AI Video Generator Convert text into professional videos for your business with just a few clicks with HubSpot's Clip Creator. Generate in moments with AI. Customize to your needs. Use free video templates. Finalize and drive results. Build Your Video 1. Avatar actors and likeness licensing are the new norm. Instead of hiring an actor to read a script or act in an ad, businesses can now license an actor’s likeness, use it to train an AI model, and then use that model to create ads and avatars. This enables marketers to quickly generate a variety of content, testing, and refining different approaches and messages without the logistical constraints of traditional video shoots. For example, this viral video ad features a woman casually talking about a product while seated inside her car. What’s so significant about it, however, is that while she’s a real actress hired off of Fiverr, the video itself is generated by AI video, using tools like Arcads. \"This produces video content that is human-trained but AI-agent delivered,\" Kieran explains. \"That’s quite an unbelievable concept to think through.\" 2. Low-quality but authentic content is driving engagement. Polished, high-budget video ads are quickly becoming a thing of the past — or at least, less favored by audiences. Instead, low-production, personable videos are taking the lead, outperforming traditional ads on platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels. Take, for example, the viral video I mentioned above: it’s not polished or high-budget. Instead, it’s set in a poorly-lit car, with an unflattering angle. Yet people are more likely to engage with it. Why? \"Because it feels authentic, relatable, and personable,\" Kieran explains. \"It’s how a real person would talk about a product.\" For marketers, this shift means experimenting with AI tools like HeyGen and InfinityAI, which quickly create videos that drive engagement, despite — or even because of — their imperfections. 3. Video personalization and customization are must-haves. Hyper-personalized videos that cater to customers’ accessibility needs, languages, and preferences are essential for successful marketing campaigns. During the episode, we highlighted how AI tools can use customer data from your CRM platform — like call logs, support tickets, and emails — to craft personalized video scripts. This enables marketing teams to deliver tailored content that feels uniquely targeted and relevant to each individual viewer. We also experimented with HeyGen’s groundbreaking Avatar in Motion, which creates customized avatars based on your own likeness. Move your hands, make gestures, or use unique tones of voice, and HeyGen will flawlessly track, translate, and lip-sync your video with any customizable input text. 4. Accelerated iteration is driving innovation. AI tools significantly speed up the iteration cycle for creative video content and limit lengthy and expensive production cycles. For example, during the episode, I showed Kieran how I designed and launched a video ad in less than 15 minutes. To stay ahead, marketers need to quickly and constantly innovate, as the ease of copying and templatizing creative work will lead to a rapid commoditization of content. Standard approaches to AI-powered video content may outperform current methods in the short term because they’re new and different. But effectiveness is likely to peak within the first six to twelve months. Then, it will taper off as audiences get used to it and become aware of its widespread use. \"Your best-performing content will now be ‘best-performing’ for a much shorter period of time,\" says Kieran. In other words: your iteration of ‘creative’ as a marketer will have to increase exponentially. Differentiation will rely heavily on the unique 10-20% of creative input, putting increased pressure on marketers to continually produce new and distinctive ideas. Three Tips for Integrating AI into Your Video Marketing Strategy Learn how to incorporate AI into your video workflow by downloading our AI Guide for Marketers and following the tips below. 1. Experiment. Experiment. Experiment. Test different AI video tools to understand their benefits and limitations, helping you find the best fit for your campaign needs and goals. This keeps your team ahead of the competition, identifying new opportunities to capture the attention of your customers. 2. Enhance the Tools You Already Use Not sure where to start? Try using AI video features that already exist in your current marketing tech stack. For example, platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Mailchimp offer AI-powered capabilities that boost your marketing effectiveness by automating production processes and offering more detailed performance insights for iteration. 3. Monitor Legal and Ethical Considerations As AI video production becomes more prevalent, legal considerations around likeness licensing and content use will become increasingly important. Invest in the proper training and resources now to ensure you are using AI effectively and ethically in the future.

Personalized content tends to be more engaging and has a greater impact on conversions. With AI, marketers can: Analyze viewer behavior and preferences to create customized clips. Utilize AI clips generators to produce content that speaks directly to the interests and needs of different audience segments. Implement dynamic video content that changes based on the viewer’s interactions. Improvement in Viewer Engagement and Retention AI clips contribute to higher viewer engagement and retention rates. By offering relevant and personalized content, marketers can capture the attention of their audience more effectively.

Here are some strategies to consider: Keep videos concise, ideally under 2 minutes, to maintain viewer attention. Make the first 3-5 seconds captivating to hook viewers immediately. Use square or vertical formats for social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok, which are optimized for mobile viewing. Incorporate subtitles and captions to accommodate viewers who watch videos without sound. By aligning video length and format with audience preferences, you improve the likelihood of your message being effectively communicated.

A/B Testing: Conduct A/B tests on different versions of your video clips to determine which elements drive better results.

This emerging technology, which has its roots in the same AI advancements that brought us deep learning and neural networks, is now extending its reach into video production. By simply feeding it a text prompt, you can get AI to generate videos that were once solely the domain of skilled videographers and editors, redefining the boundaries of machine learning and AI capabilities. The potential of this technology is immense. Imagine crafting detailed, high-quality videos in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost traditionally required, democratizing video production for a wider range of creators, businesses, and industries. From personalized marketing campaigns to educational content, the applications seem endless. The mechanism behind AI video generation The core of AI video generation lies in advanced machine learning models, particularly those employing deep learning techniques. These AI models are trained on vast datasets of video content to learn to recognize and replicate patterns, motions, and sequences. When provided with a text prompt, AI interprets it through natural language processing, then employs generative algorithms to create a corresponding video sequence. This process involves not only visual replication but also an understanding of continuity and context, ensuring that the generated video isn’t just a series of disjointed images but a cohesive visual narrative. Recent advancements in this field are remarkable. From reduced processing times to accuracy, the realism of these videos has seen substantial improvements, with some systems achieving nearly photorealistic results. Real-life applications As we pivot from the technical aspects to practical applications, the impact of text-to-video AI technology on enterprise-level strategies and tech innovation becomes evident. This technology is poised to transform the approach to video content creation across a spectrum of industries. Transforming advertising In the realm of marketing and advertising, AI-driven video creation stands as a game-changer. Imagine the ability to produce tailor-made, high-quality video advertisements aligned with consumer data insights. For businesses, particularly enterprises, this means a significant elevation of marketing agility and customer engagement. AI-generated content facilitates a swift response to market trends, enabling companies to stay ahead in competitive environments. This technological edge is invaluable, not just for large corporations but also for startups and midsize businesses, offering them a level playing field in terms of advertising quality and innovation. Revolutionizing education In education and corporate training, AI-generated videos are redefining the way information is delivered. They convert complex textual data into engaging, easily digestible visual narratives, enhancing understanding and retention. This aspect is particularly crucial in corporate settings where training and development are key to employee growth and organizational success. The technology’s adaptability to different learning styles makes it a potent tool for personalized learning experiences, both in academic institutions and in corporate learning environments. Redefining entertainment For the entertainment industry, including in film and game development, this AI technology offers unprecedented freedom. It can craft detailed, realistic scenes without the heavy reliance on expensive CGI or physical sets. This democratization of content creation is a boon for independent creators and smaller studios, enabling them to compete with larger entities by producing high-quality content within limited budgets. This paves the way for more diverse storytelling and innovative visual experiences. Current limitations and ethical considerations The advent of AI-generated videos has ushered in an era where hyperrealistic content can be produced with ease. For businesses and leaders, this technological leap presents both a remarkable opportunity and a significant ethical challenge. AI’s ability to create lifelike videos means that content previously requiring extensive resources can now be generated quickly and cost-effectively. However, this raises critical questions about authenticity. The challenge lies in the difficulty of distinguishing AI-generated content from actual footage. As these videos become increasingly realistic, the line between artificial and authentic becomes blurred. This has profound implications for trust and credibility in the corporate world. For instance, a seemingly authentic video of a famous personality making a statement could be entirely fabricated, potentially leading to market manipulations or damage to corporate reputations. The potential of AI to create misleading or false content is a concern that extends beyond the boundaries of unauthenticity and into the realm of misinformation. This technology, in the wrong hands, can be used to fabricate content for propagating false narratives or misinformation, with significant implications for businesses and society. For example, deepfakes—AI-created videos that make it appear as though someone is saying or doing something they did not—have been used to create fake news and political propaganda, impacting public opinion and trust. In the business world, similar tactics could be used to create false endorsements or damaging statements, affecting market dynamics and corporate reputations. Moving forward In the face of rapid advancements in AI-generated video content, the development of standards and regulations is crucial to ensure ethical usage and prevent misuse. Both existing and proposed regulations aim to create a framework within which AI can be safely and responsibly utilized. For instance, the European Union’s AI Act, one of the first major frameworks, establishes rules and standards for AI systems, including those used in video generation. Tech companies and developers play a pivotal role in shaping the ethical landscape of AI-generated video content. Many leading firms are already implementing measures like content watermarking, which subtly marks AI-generated videos to differentiate them from real footage. This helps in authenticating content and aids in tracking and managing AI-generated media. It not only mitigates risks but also aligns the organization with broader ethical considerations in the digital age. As we stand on the brink of this new era, it’s imperative to pause and consider the ethical landscape that lies ahead. The very features that make generative AI in video creation so revolutionary—its speed, efficiency, and ability to mimic reality—also raise significant ethical concerns. Primary among these are issues related to content unauthenticity and the potential for misinformation. In a world where seeing is believing, AI-generated videos that are indistinguishable from reality could blur the lines of truth, challenging our perception of authenticity. We can already see AI video generators being used for real-time video translation and localization, making content universally accessible. There’s also potential in virtual reality and augmented reality, where AI could generate interactive, immersive environments in real time. As AI becomes more prevalent, balancing its impact on traditional video production roles is crucial. Addressing these challenges will pave the way for wider adoption, making content creation more inclusive, efficient, and innovative. Strategies such as implementing digital watermarks, leveraging blockchain technology for content authentication, and utilizing of AI-based detection tools are already making significant strides towards safeguarding authenticity. For leaders and stakeholders, the path forward involves a conscious commitment to the responsible use of AI technology. This commitment should manifest itself in tangible actions: supporting the development of ethical AI, investing in advanced technologies to identify AI-generated misinformation, and taking an active role in shaping regulations and policies. In doing so, we not only protect the integrity of digital content but also ensure the responsible evolution of AI technology, balancing innovation with ethical considerations.
