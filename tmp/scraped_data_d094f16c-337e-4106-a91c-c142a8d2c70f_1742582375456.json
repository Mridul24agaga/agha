You spend hours trimming clips, syncing audio, and adjusting colors to get that perfect look. However, AI video creators and editors can handle the boring parts and give you more time to showcase creativity. Today, video editors are smarter than ever thanks to modern tools. From auto-captioning to object removal and even generating videos from scratch, AI video editing tools are changing the game. We tested several AI video editing apps over the past 2 weeks. Here are some of the best ones that we found useful. Table of Contents 1. Adobe Premiere Pro (Pro Video Editor with AI Features) 2. DaVinci Resolve (Free Hollywood-Grade Editing With AI Tools) 3. CapCut (Simple, Powerful Mobile AI Video Editor) 4. Opus Clip (Convert Long Videos to Short Clips) 5. Descript (Edit Videos Like a Text Document) 6. Runway (Collection of AI Tools) 7. ElevenLabs (Create ultra-realistic AI voiceovers) 8. HeyGen (Generate AI Avatars) 9. Sora by OpenAI (AI Video Generator) 1. Adobe Premiere Pro (Pro Video Editor with AI Features) Adobe Premiere Pro is a top-tier professional video editing software packed with various features that let you do everything from speed ramps to color grading. But it also has AI features to simplify and speed up your editing process. For example, it has Generative extend, which uses AI to add extra frames and extend clips smoothly. So you do not worry about awkward sudden cuts if you do not have the footage needed. You also get object addition and removal tools letting you seamlessly erase unwanted objects or insert new ones. Then there is Smart Masking, making it easy to track and edit moving objects. The platform also recently introduced Text-based editing, which lets edit clips like you are working with text. For audio, you have speech to text in over 18 languages and an AI Audio category tagging feature to automatically label audio as dialog, music, or effects. You can also enhance the audio using AI or auto-color to fix exposure and color balance. Basically a professional-level video editor with AI features sprinkled where you need them. However, it comes under an expensive subscription model that costs $22.99/month as a starting plan. Some of these AI models also run locally and require a high-end computer to take advantage of this completely. | Pros | Cons | | --- | --- | | Powerful AI tools for editing and audio | Expensive subscription model | | Text-based editing simplifies workflows | Steep learning curve for beginners | | Speech-to-text in multiple languages | Requires a high-end computer | | Object removal and smart masking features | Some AI tools are in beta and may be unstable | | Professional-grade color correction tools | Generative Extend limited to 1080p at 30 FPS | Pricing and Availability Premiere Pro Single App Plan: $22.99/month (100 GB cloud storage included) Creative Cloud All Apps Plan: $54.99/month (Includes over 20 Adobe apps) Student and Teacher Plan: $19.99/month (first year, then $34.99/month) Business Plan: $89.99/month per license (All apps + team features) Platform: Available on Windows and macOS Try Premiere Pro 2. DaVinci Resolve (Free Hollywood-Grade Editing With AI Tools) Looking for a professional-level video editor that’s also free? DaVinci Resolve is a solid choice. Just like Premiere Pro, it comes packed with AI video editing and enhancing tools to make your editing smoother and faster. Take IntelliTrack AI Tracking, for example. It uses the DaVinci Neural Engine to track objects and even create immersive audio panning based on movement. With Person Mask, you can automatically detect and track people for precise color grading or effects. Coming to audio, it has Music Remixer FX that can reshape your music track to fit the style you need. Can mute vocals, or specific instruments in the music using AI. DaVinci Resolve’s AI tools also speed up your workflow. Scene Cut Detection automatically detects parts that you may want to cut in the clips, saving you hours manually chopping unneeded parts. There’s even more like SuperScale for upscaling, Audio Ducker that lowers background music during dialog automatically, speech-to-text for captions, etc. | Pros | Cons | | --- | --- | | Powerful AI features in the free version | Limited collaboration in the free version | | Advanced color grading tools | Steep learning curve | | Lifetime license (one-time payment) | High-end hardware needed for smooth performance | | Accurate object and person tracking | Some advanced AI tools are Studio-only | | Social media-friendly auto-reframe | Limited collaboration in free version | Pricing and Availability DaVinci Resolve (Free): $0 – Offers extensive editing tools and basic AI features.

CapCut (Simple, Powerful Mobile AI Video Editor) If you want a simple mobile first AI-powered video editor, CapCut is the best option available. It started on Android and iPhone but then launched a desktop app. CapCut’s AI features cover everything from script creation to final edits. Script-to-Video turns your scripts into engaging videos with auto-generated visuals, while Text-to-Speech provides natural-sounding voiceovers in different styles. Need captions fast? Auto-Captions generate them instantly, making your videos more accessible. Plus, Background Removal lets you isolate subjects without a green screen, perfect for creative edits. CapCut also helps with platform-ready videos. Auto Reframe resizes your videos for social platforms like Instagram and TikTok. Need help with ideas?

For smooth footage, AI Movement stabilizes shaky clips, giving your videos a polished look. It also has a free version that comes with basic AI tools like text-to-speech. To get all the tools CapCut can provide, you need a standard plan that costs $9.99/month.

It has AI-powered curation feature that can analyze videos to exact engaging highlight parts. It can also adjust the frame focusing on the main subject automatically. However, Opus Clip takes things one notch above for the short-form content. For example, it adds additional B-Roll with relevant visuals and adds animated captions with templates for better viewer engagement. Opus also offers a Virality Score, estimating each clip’s potential for social media success. Though it does not work as you expect, so take it with a pinch of salt. Also, it has a Social Post Scheduler feature allowing you to directly post on connected platforms making your short video generation process a lot easier. The only downside is, the free plan only comes with 60 minutes/month and has watermarks.

Descript (Edit Videos Like a Text Document) Descript makes video editing as simple as editing text. You can simply edit the transcript of the video and changes will be applied to the video. For example, when you remove the text from the transcript, that part of the video will be removed from the final video. You can also change the text or add any additional text to the transcript, it uses Voice Cloning to create your voice and add that to the video. It also has AI features to edit the transcript.

You spend hours trimming clips, syncing audio, and adjusting colors to get that perfect look. However, AI video creators and editors can handle the boring parts and give you more time to showcase creativity. Today, video editors are smarter than ever thanks to modern tools. From auto-captioning to object removal and even generating videos from scratch, AI video editing tools are changing the game. We tested several AI video editing apps over the past 2 weeks. Here are some of the best ones that we found useful. Table of Contents 1. Adobe Premiere Pro (Pro Video Editor with AI Features) 2. DaVinci Resolve (Free Hollywood-Grade Editing With AI Tools) 3. CapCut (Simple, Powerful Mobile AI Video Editor) 4. Opus Clip (Convert Long Videos to Short Clips) 5. Descript (Edit Videos Like a Text Document) 6. Runway (Collection of AI Tools) 7. ElevenLabs (Create ultra-realistic AI voiceovers) 8. HeyGen (Generate AI Avatars) 9. Sora by OpenAI (AI Video Generator) 1. Adobe Premiere Pro (Pro Video Editor with AI Features) Adobe Premiere Pro is a top-tier professional video editing software packed with various features that let you do everything from speed ramps to color grading. But it also has AI features to simplify and speed up your editing process. For example, it has Generative extend, which uses AI to add extra frames and extend clips smoothly. So you do not worry about awkward sudden cuts if you do not have the footage needed. You also get object addition and removal tools letting you seamlessly erase unwanted objects or insert new ones. Then there is Smart Masking, making it easy to track and edit moving objects. The platform also recently introduced Text-based editing, which lets edit clips like you are working with text. For audio, you have speech to text in over 18 languages and an AI Audio category tagging feature to automatically label audio as dialog, music, or effects. You can also enhance the audio using AI or auto-color to fix exposure and color balance. Basically a professional-level video editor with AI features sprinkled where you need them. However, it comes under an expensive subscription model that costs $22.99/month as a starting plan. Some of these AI models also run locally and require a high-end computer to take advantage of this completely. | Pros | Cons | | --- | --- | | Powerful AI tools for editing and audio | Expensive subscription model | | Text-based editing simplifies workflows | Steep learning curve for beginners | | Speech-to-text in multiple languages | Requires a high-end computer | | Object removal and smart masking features | Some AI tools are in beta and may be unstable | | Professional-grade color correction tools | Generative Extend limited to 1080p at 30 FPS | Pricing and Availability Premiere Pro Single App Plan: $22.99/month (100 GB cloud storage included) Creative Cloud All Apps Plan: $54.99/month (Includes over 20 Adobe apps) Student and Teacher Plan: $19.99/month (first year, then $34.99/month) Business Plan: $89.99/month per license (All apps + team features) Platform: Available on Windows and macOS Try Premiere Pro 2. DaVinci Resolve (Free Hollywood-Grade Editing With AI Tools) Looking for a professional-level video editor that’s also free? DaVinci Resolve is a solid choice. Just like Premiere Pro, it comes packed with AI video editing and enhancing tools to make your editing smoother and faster. Take IntelliTrack AI Tracking, for example. It uses the DaVinci Neural Engine to track objects and even create immersive audio panning based on movement. With Person Mask, you can automatically detect and track people for precise color grading or effects. Coming to audio, it has Music Remixer FX that can reshape your music track to fit the style you need. Can mute vocals, or specific instruments in the music using AI. DaVinci Resolve’s AI tools also speed up your workflow. Scene Cut Detection automatically detects parts that you may want to cut in the clips, saving you hours manually chopping unneeded parts. There’s even more like SuperScale for upscaling, Audio Ducker that lowers background music during dialog automatically, speech-to-text for captions, etc. | Pros | Cons | | --- | --- | | Powerful AI features in the free version | Limited collaboration in the free version | | Advanced color grading tools | Steep learning curve | | Lifetime license (one-time payment) | High-end hardware needed for smooth performance | | Accurate object and person tracking | Some advanced AI tools are Studio-only | | Social media-friendly auto-reframe | Limited collaboration in free version | Pricing and Availability DaVinci Resolve (Free): $0 – Offers extensive editing tools and basic AI features.

CapCut (Simple, Powerful Mobile AI Video Editor) If you want a simple mobile first AI-powered video editor, CapCut is the best option available. It started on Android and iPhone but then launched a desktop app. CapCut’s AI features cover everything from script creation to final edits. Script-to-Video turns your scripts into engaging videos with auto-generated visuals, while Text-to-Speech provides natural-sounding voiceovers in different styles. Need captions fast? Auto-Captions generate them instantly, making your videos more accessible. Plus, Background Removal lets you isolate subjects without a green screen, perfect for creative edits. CapCut also helps with platform-ready videos. Auto Reframe resizes your videos for social platforms like Instagram and TikTok. Need help with ideas?

For smooth footage, AI Movement stabilizes shaky clips, giving your videos a polished look. It also has a free version that comes with basic AI tools like text-to-speech. To get all the tools CapCut can provide, you need a standard plan that costs $9.99/month. Currently, not available for new users, but existing users or downloading via third-party platforms like Softonic Works. | Pros | Cons | | --- | --- | | Strong AI tools even in free version | Advanced tools require Pro subscription | | Auto-captioning and text-to-speech | Performance issues on low-end devices | | Social-media-friendly auto-reframe | Several features moved behind paywalls | | Background removal without green screens | Risk of generic output from trendy filters | | Smooth AI-powered stabilization | U.S. app store ban affects availability | Pricing and Availability Free Version: Includes essential AI tools.

Opus Clip (Convert Long Videos to Short Clips) Already have a long video? With Opus Clip, you can turn long videos into short videos for platforms like TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels. It has AI-powered curation feature that can analyze videos to exact engaging highlight parts. It can also adjust the frame focusing on the main subject automatically. However, Opus Clip takes things one notch above for the short-form content. For example, it adds additional B-Roll with relevant visuals and adds animated captions with templates for better viewer engagement. Opus also offers a Virality Score, estimating each clip’s potential for social media success. Though it does not work as you expect, so take it with a pinch of salt. Also, it has a Social Post Scheduler feature allowing you to directly post on connected platforms making your short video generation process a lot easier. The only downside is, the free plan only comes with 60 minutes/month and has watermarks. The starter plan to remove this costs around $15/month. | Pros | Cons | | --- | --- | | Strong AI-powered editing tools | Free version has watermarks | | Auto-captioning with high accuracy | Some AI selections may lack context | | Virality score for social content | Limited uploads in free version | | Supports multiple platforms for sharing | Paid version is required for brand templates | | AI B-roll enhances storytelling | AI clip selection can be hit-or-miss | Pricing and Availability Free Plan: 60 minutes/month (Watermarked clips, basic tools) Starter Plan: $15/month – 150 minutes, no watermarks, virality score Pro Plan: $29/month – 500 minutes, multi-user support, AI B-roll Platforms: Web-based (No install needed) Global Availability: Accessible in 180+ countries Try Opus Clip 5. Descript (Edit Videos Like a Text Document) Descript makes video editing as simple as editing text. You can simply edit the transcript of the video and changes will be applied to the video. For example, when you remove the text from the transcript, that part of the video will be removed from the final video. You can also change the text or add any additional text to the transcript, it uses Voice Cloning to create your voice and add that to the video. It also has AI features to edit the transcript. For example, filler work removal feature cuts out words ‘um’ and ‘uh’ automatically. You can also generate scripts using AI. Also has various other AI features like Eye contact that adjusts your gaze direction to maintain engagement. With the free plan, you get 1 hour of transcription work. But for more AI features, you need a Hobbyist or Creator plan that costs $12 and $24 per month. | Pros | Cons | | --- | --- | | Simple text-based video and audio editing | Free plan has limited transcription hours | | AI-powered voice cloning with Overdub | Higher-tier plans are expensive | | Studio Sound for professional audio | Requires internet for cloud features | | Automatic filler word removal | Advanced AI tools are paywalled | | Built-in social content generators | Can feel complex for beginners | Pricing and Availability Free Plan: $0 – 1 hour transcription, basic editing tools Hobbyist Plan: $12/month – 10 hours of transcription, 1080p exports, basic AI tools Creator Plan: $24/month – 30 hours transcription, 4K exports, advanced AI tools Business Plan: $40/month – 40 hours of transcription, professional AI tools, team collaboration Platforms: macOS, Windows, and Web Try Descript 6.

ElevenLabs (Create ultra-realistic AI voiceovers) ElevenLabs is an audio-focused AI platform offering text-to-speech, voice changer, voice cloner, translate, and text-to-SFX features. The platform supports over 120+ voices across 29 languages. What makes ElevenLabs stand apart from similar tools is the quality of the audio generation especially in the Eleven V2 version. You can generate with either prompts or provide a complete script and convert the text into voice. However, the free plan only has limited credits useful for testing the platform. If you prefer to use it, you may need one of the multiple paid plans offered by ElevenLabs starting from $5 to $1320 per month. | Pros | Cons | | --- | --- | | Realistic text-to-speech with voice cloning | Ethical concerns around misuse | | Supports 29 languages and 50 accents | AI voices may lack emotional depth | | Simple UI | Free plan has limited credits | | Customizable voice parameters | Privacy risks with voice cloning | | SFX Generation | Premium plans required for pro features | Pricing and Availability Free Plan: $0 – 10,000 credits, 10 minutes TTS/month, API access Starter Plan: $5/month – 30,000 credits, extended usage Creator Plan: $22/month – 100,000 credits, voice cloning, multi-speaker support Pro Plan: $99/month – 500,000 credits, advanced API, analytics Scale Plan: $330/month – 2,000,000 credits, large-scale projects Business Plan: $1,320/month – 11,000,000 credits, enterprise-level support Platforms: Web, iOS, Android (via ElevenReader app) Try ElevenLabs 8.

The Storyboard adds a timeline and lets us generate videos according to the timeline of prompts.

It turns out, the greatest tools for creativity are those that create with you. AI is reshaping text, visual, and audio production, and it's beginning to show up in AI-powered video editing software that helps producers reduce (or eliminate) time-consuming grunt work and apply polished video effects in minutes—work that used to take professional producers hours to do. The key with this software is that it acts as \"Suggestive AI\" for you and your team: rather than relying on AI to create the entire video for you, it's best used to ideate, create a basic foundation, and speed up edits. That way, you still control the creative vision and fit the video to the needs of your side project, brand, or business. We decided to try all of the best AI video editing tools available today. After testing each product individually, we summarized our notes on the best-in-class software we tried, along with the features, pros/cons, and pricing of each. Keep reading to learn more. The best AI video editing software in 2023 1. Kapwing The best web-based AI video editor Kapwing is our web-based video editor that focuses on speed, simplicity, and repurposing to help you grow your reach. Our flagship AI feature is called Smart Cut, an automatic video editor that removes awkward silence in dialogue, white noise, silences between dialogue, and even background noises—all without removing the speaker's voice. For even faster editing, use Smart Cut first then use Trim with Transcript, our text-based video editing tool. Select and delete any unwanted or repeat words/phrases from the transcript to remove them from your video. Kapwing is a fully-featured editor that comes with other AI-powered tools, too. Everything from video background removal (plus audio), auto-generated subtitles, video trimming and resizing, text to speech edits, video blur, and audio waveforms are available and feature AI enhancements that speed up editing time and reduce headaches. Many tools are a one-click experience and handle time-consuming editing tasks so you can focus on being creative. In addition to AI editing tools, Kapwing also has a suite of generative AI tools powered by OpenAI to help you make awesome video faster. Draft a video script in moments with the AI script generator or create a whole video in just a few clicks with our AI video generator. If you already have a long-form video, use the AI clip maker to automatically extract shorter clips and edit to your liking. Since Kapwing is built web-first, there's no desktop software to download which makes it the perfect video editor for Chromebook users or anyone who needs a lightning-fast editor that won't slow down their machine. Kapwing works for any video project but is best used for short- to medium-form social media and marketing videos, whether you're an independent creator or a brand. Pricing: Free: Edit videos up to 4 mins long; export in 720p; auto subtitler for 10 mins/month Pro: Edit videos up to 120 minutes long; export in 4k; unlimited auto-subtitling; unlimited cloud storage; access all AI-based editing tools 2. Adobe Premiere Pro The best desktop-based AI video editor Adobe Sensei powers the AI and machine learning-based tools in Adobe's products, some of which are available in Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe's popular desktop software for video editing. Note that Sensei is not a separate product for Premiere Pro, but rather the name Adobe has given to the AI-powered tools in its suite of products; the features below are available by default in Adobe Premiere Pro. Premiere Pro's AI tools focus on helping producers create more consistent and polished-looking videos without spending an excessive amount of time hand-editing the details. The main features include instant color matching, video transitions, automatic scene edits, automatic reframing of focal points, and content-aware fill to remove objects from your videos. Adobe also says they'll build more generative AI tools into Premiere Pro by way of Adobe Sensei in the future, and that these tools will likely integrate with their other nascent generative AI products like Adobe Firefly, which is currently in beta. Pricing: Free: Not available for free, though there's a 7-day free trial Premiere Pro: $21/month per user Creative Cloud: $55/month per user 3. Synthesia The best avatar-focused AI video editor Synthesia is a product in an emerging category of top AI video generators, which focus less on refining existing video and more on generating the content—from subjects, to backgrounds, to voices—with the help of AI. Synthesia first gained popularity through its AI avatars being used on YouTube to demonstrate the product. The way it works is you start with an AI avatar and the scene that they'll appear in. Scenes can range from real-life imitations like groceries or medical facilities, or they can be abstract like colorful backgrounds or presentation-style backdrops. Then, you pair the avatar with a script and a voice you've selected; Synthesia offers voices in 120 languages and accents, which helps with localization. Avatar-style videos are helpful for scaling video production and personalization. Though, you need to be wary of the \"uncanny valley\" that's often present in these videos without any editing. And, some viewers may want a disclaimer when they receive an AI-based video, lest they feel tricked into thinking the person speaking is human. Pricing: Personal: $30 per user per month; 10 video credits; 1 account seat Enterprise: Pricing only available through Sales 4. Muse.ai The best AI-based video search editor Muse.ai is an interesting product that blends a responsive HTML5 video player with backend hosting for video files along with an AI-powered search that can automatically identify and tag objects, text, sounds, and more. Producers can use the search to quickly jump to key moments rather than wading through hours of video footage. Muse does allow you to manually tag any moment in your video but says the AI-based tagging will allow users to immediately start searching their videos with Live Search to find scenes, sounds, and even people based on a simple search. Other tools on Muse are focused on hosting and embedding your videos online. These include a responsive HTML5 video player, video hosting with backups, support for 4k videos, and even the option to embed searchable video collections on any webpage, so your users can quickly access the video they need. Pricing: Visionary: $10/month; 100 GB of hosting; 1 account seats; unlimited embeds Venture: $40/month; 500 GB of hosting; 3 account seats; calls to action; advanced player customizations 5. Descript The best AI-based transcription editor Descript is an audio and video editor that's built around its transcription feature: users can edit multimedia files like audio and video by editing the text in the transcript, which will then be reflected in the audio/video itself. Editing via transcription is intuitive for non-producers, though the edits often need to be tightened up manually. Descript also comes with a few other AI-based tools, including voice cloning to match current speakers, background noise removal, and green screen effects. Non-AI tools include basic video hosting and screen recording for walkthrough and explainer videos. Collaboration tools within Descript also resemble working in a doc, with comments and threads being housed inside of the video transcript. Real-time comments are available and teammates are notified when there is feedback to act on. Pricing: Free: 1 hour of transcription edits; 10-minute length for green screen & studio sound Creator: $15/month per user; 10 hours of transcription edits; unlimited exports; 4k resolution; 10 minute length for green screen & studio sound Pro: $30/month per user; 10 hours of transcription edits; unlimited everything else Related: The 7 Best Video Editors for Windows Users in 2023 6. Pictory The best content repurposing AI editor Pictory specializes in repurposing video across platforms; its flagship AI feature cuts down long-form video automatically based on what length you specify. Once you've asked Pictory to shorten a video by a certain amount, e.g. 10% or 25% of the original video's length, the tool will find the \"highlights\" within the video and keep those in the edit it outputs for you. The final product usually needs to be manually edited for polish, but the tool does help cut down on removing slow parts and dead air, especially for very long videos. Pictory also touts a blog-to-video feature that promises to take blog text and turn it into a video based on a transcript (the blog's text), stock video, and music/voiceover. Again, it's usually not fit to publish on something like a YouTube channel, but if you're mostly looking to offer your audience a way to watch/listen to the content, it serves its purpose. Pricing: Standard: $23/month per user; 30 videos & 10 hours of transcription per month Premium: $47/month per user; 60 videos & 20 hours of transcription per month Enterprise: Pricing only available through Sales 7. Runway The best AI editor for style transfers Runway is a collection of AI-based video tools that mostly focus on generative text to video. The main draw of Runway is the use of \"style transfers\" for video that's enabled by their machine learning tech called GEN-1. Style transfers allow you to apply the visual aesthetic of an image or another video to a video you've already made. AI overlays the style to your video, which means that the subjects and background still serve as the frame for your video, but the entire aesthetic is adapted to another style. For example, imagine overlaying a video of yourself talking to another person and then overlaying that video with a claymation style. The resulting video would be your conversation in claymation. That's the promise of style transfers—they're still a little bit rough at the moment, but the tech is very new and will likely improve over time. Right now, users can create a 5-second video with the style transfer feature, before being asked to pay more. Pricing: Free: Limit of 3 projects; limited credits for AI tools with no ability to purchase more; 720p exports Standard: $15/month per user; unlimited projects; access to AI training tools Pro: $35/month per user; 500GB in asset storage; unlimited projects; 2250 credits/month (roughly 2 minutes of generated video) 8. Lumen5 The best talking head AI editor Lumen5's most touted feature is its AI-based \"blog to video\" tool, which allows users to drop in a blog link—no transcript needed—and get back a summary in video form featuring stock footage, text overlays, and basic transitions. We've mentioned that editing is often needed for these videos, and Lumen's \"post-generated\" edits are useful and intuitive. There are multiple templated styles to choose from, and it's simple to resize videos into different aspect ratios in case you'd like to repost across multiple channels. If you'd like to appear on screen yourself, Lumen5 also offers a talking head video format that auto-generates captions and callouts and allows you to edit the person speaking through the transcript, similar to Descript. There aren't many templates to choose from, but there are options to use custom colors and fonts to match your brand. Pricing: Basic: $29/month; no branding; access to icons and stock videos Starter: $79/month; 1080p videos; custom fonts and colors Professional: $199/month; custom watermarks; upload fonts; multiple saved templates and brand kits Find the right AI-powered platform for you Gone are the days of hand-editing every single detail of your video. From subtitles, to avatars, to full-blown automatic edits, AI-based tools are speeding up the video production process and helping producers and marketers spend more time on creative direction. The key is to remember that they are, ultimately, just another set of tools to do the job. Start with the outcome that you want to achieve—for yourself and your viewer—and work backward to find the right tools that make reaching the outcome faster and easier. FAQ for AI video editing software What's the best AI video editor? That depends on your video editing needs. Kapwing, Adobe Premiere, Synthesia, and Muse all offer AI-based video editing tools that help producers automatically remove silence, add effects, generate avatars, and search video files. Does Adobe Premiere Pro have AI? Yes. Adobe Sensei is the AI and machine-learning technology that powers Adobe's products, and it allows for AI-based editing features in Adobe Premiere Pro, too. How can I create human-like avatars with AI? Human-based avatars can be created with AI video generators such as Synthesia, Elai, and Synthesys. These tools allow you to pair a human-like AI avatar with various voices, outfits, and backgrounds—the avatars will speak based on the video script you provide. Is there an AI that can make videos? Yes, but the right tool depends on what videos you want to make. AI-based editors like Kapwing can help you edit videos faster with AI, whereas tools like Runway are good for video-to-video creation with AI, where you overlay AI-generated effects to an existing video you've made. Is there a Dall-E for video? There's no Dall-E for video made by OpenAI, the creators of Dall-E.
