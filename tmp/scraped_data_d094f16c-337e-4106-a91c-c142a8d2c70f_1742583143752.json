Stock up on video ideas with the Video Idea Generator. You’re 3 questions away from your next video! Discover now By now, you’ve been told countless times that AI is the future of content creation. It’s supposed to save you time, cut costs, and help you scale video production effortlessly. Sounds great, right? But how do you actually make that happen? Let’s be real—knowing that AI can help you create more videos is one thing. Figuring out where it fits into your workflow, which tools to use, and how to keep quality high while scaling? That’s where things get tricky. Should you be using AI to script? To edit? To repurpose content across platforms? And how do you make sure your videos still feel authentic, creative, and aligned with your brand—not like something a robot churned out? That’s exactly what we’re breaking down here. This playbook cuts through the noise and gives you a clear roadmap to integrating AI into your video strategy. No vague promises—just practical ways to automate the tedious actions, free up your team’s creativity, and start producing better videos, faster. Download our tips-packed guide and transform your video creation with AI today Download our guide Why AI is Transforming Video Creation Despite the demand for video content, many marketing teams are still struggling to keep up. The problem isn’t that they don’t recognize the importance of video—it’s that traditional video creation is slow, costly, and requires expertise that not every team has. AI is stepping in to fill these gaps and help teams create videos more efficiently. 1. AI Dramatically Reduces Video Production Time One of the most significant advantages of AI-powered video tools is the ability to accelerate the production process. Traditionally, creating a marketing video involves multiple stages: scriptwriting, shooting, editing, and final approval. Even with a well-oiled workflow, a single high-quality video can take days or even weeks to produce. AI eliminates many of these bottlenecks. AI-driven script generators can turn blog posts or website content into video-ready scripts in seconds. Editing software powered by AI can automatically trim clips, add transitions, and insert captions without the need for human intervention. These advancements mean that what once took weeks can now be done in hours or even minutes. A report by HubSpot found that marketing teams using AI-powered video tools reduced production time by 50%, allowing them to produce more content without overburdening their teams​. 2. AI Slashes Video Production Costs Producing high-quality videos has traditionally been one of the most expensive aspects of content marketing. Between hiring videographers, editors, and voiceover artists—not to mention purchasing software and equipment—costs can skyrocket quickly. For many companies, outsourcing is the only feasible solution, but that comes with a hefty price tag. A professionally produced marketing video can cost anywhere from $5,000 to $50,000, depending on its complexity. AI-powered tools make it possible to produce studio-quality videos in-house for a fraction of the cost. By using AI content marketing to automate editing, repurposing, and even voiceover generation, you can produce high-quality videos without relying on expensive agencies. Companies that have embraced AI-driven video creation have reported a 40% reduction in production costs while increasing output​. 3. AI Makes Video Creation Scalable for Small Teams For many marketing teams, the challenge isn’t just cost or time—it’s bandwidth. Not every company has an in-house video expert, and when resources are limited, video often gets deprioritized in favor of other content formats. AI democratizes video creation, making it possible for non-specialists to create professional videos without deep technical knowledge. With AI-driven tools, marketing teams can generate product demos, explainer videos, social media content, and more—without needing an entire production crew. This means that even small businesses can compete with large enterprises by leveraging AI to create high-impact video content at scale and improve their video content management system. 3 Steps to bring your video creation to the next level with AI Step 1: Choosing the Right AI Video Tools Not all AI video editor tools are created equal. Depending on your goals, different platforms specialize in different aspects of video production. Here are some of the best AI-powered video tools currently available: AI-Powered Scriptwriting & Copywriting PlayPlay, Jasper AI and Copy.ai can generate marketing video scripts based on a few bullet points or existing content. This speeds up pre-production and ensures consistency in messaging. AI-Driven Editing & Repurposing PlayPlay automates the editing process, with automated-subtitles, voiceover, translation, and clipping, making it easy for teams to create branded, professional-looking videos in minutes. Descript uses AI to edit audio and video by transcribing content and allowing for seamless text-based editing. OpusClip automatically identifies key moments in long videos and creates short-form clips optimized for social media. AI-Powered Voiceovers & Subtitles PlayPlay, ElevenLabs and Murf AI generate realistic voiceovers for explainer videos, eliminating the need for professional voice actors. PlayPlay, Kapwing and Synthesia provide AI-generated subtitles and translations, making it easy to localize videos for global audiences. The right tool for your video creation Find a tool that provides all these AI features in one, to slash video production costs. Try PlayPlay! Step 2: Integrating AI into Your Video Workflow Once you’ve selected your tools, the next step is integrating AI into your video production process. 1. Automating Scripting & Storyboarding Instead of writing scripts from scratch, AI-powered tools can turn blog posts, product pages, or webinar transcripts into ready-to-use video scripts. Some AI platforms even provide storyboarding features, helping teams visualize how their videos will unfold. 2. AI-Powered Editing & Repurposing AI tools can automatically cut clips, add captions, and enhance video quality with little to no manual intervention. This is especially valuable for repurposing long-form content, such as turning a 30-minute webinar into bite-sized social media clips. 3. Scaling Video Production with AI With AI automating many of the most time-consuming aspects of video creation, marketing teams can increase their video output without increasing their workload. AI-driven content repurposing ensures that one piece of content can be used across multiple channels, formats, and audiences. Step 3: Measuring AI Video Performance AI-powered video creation isn’t just about producing more content—it’s about producing better content, more efficiently. But how do you measure the actual impact AI has on your video marketing efforts? Like any other marketing initiative, success is in the data. By tracking the right metrics, teams can determine whether AI-driven video creation is improving efficiency, cutting costs, and delivering better engagement. Let’s break down the key performance indicators (KPIs) that matter most when measuring AI video success. 1. Production Time Saved: Is AI Speeding Up the Process? For many teams, time savings are the most immediate benefit of AI-powered video creation. Traditional video production can take days or even weeks, while AI automates many of the most time-consuming tasks. AI tools can: Auto-generate scripts from blog posts or raw data. Reduce manual editing time by identifying the best moments for short-form content. Auto-caption and translate videos, eliminating the need for manual transcription. How to measure it: Track pre-AI vs. post-AI production times: Compare how long it took to create a video before implementing AI tools. Monitor the number of videos produced per month: Is AI allowing your team to scale production without increasing headcount? 2. Engagement Rate: Are AI-Generated Videos Capturing Attention? At the heart of any video strategy is engagement. Are people actually watching your AI-generated videos? Are they clicking, commenting, and sharing? AI has the potential to enhance engagement by optimizing videos for specific audiences. AI-powered platforms analyze viewer behavior to suggest better cuts, pacing, and even colors or text overlays that hold attention for longer. How to measure it: Watch time: Are people watching your AI-edited videos longer than manually edited ones? Click-through rates (CTR): AI-generated videos with dynamic thumbnails and auto-generated captions often perform better in social feeds. Social interactions: Are AI-created videos getting more likes, shares, and comments? 3. Cost Efficiency: Is AI Helping Reduce Production Costs? While AI tools require initial investment, they often reduce production costs in the long run by decreasing the need for external resources. AI can replace expensive outsourcing by automating scriptwriting, editing, and repurposing. How to measure it: Compare monthly video production expenses before and after AI adoption. Calculate cost per video with and without AI-powered automation. Track reductions in outsourcing expenses (e.g., fewer freelance video editors needed). 4. Conversion Metrics: Are AI-Powered Videos Driving Results? At the end of the day, video marketing is about delivering results—whether that means generating leads, increasing brand awareness, or driving sales. AI-powered videos should not only save time and money but also increase conversion rates. How to measure it: Track conversion rates on landing pages with AI-generated videos vs. text-based content. Compare lead generation numbers between AI-assisted video campaigns and traditional video campaigns. Measure ROI by analyzing how AI-enhanced video contributes to the customer journey. The Takeaway AI-powered video tools should not just improve efficiency but also enhance content performance. Measuring success requires a combination of engagement metrics, time savings, cost reductions, and conversion rates. Companies that track these metrics closely will be able to fine-tune their AI video strategies for maximum impact.

AI in video marketing is still in its early stages, but it’s evolving rapidly. Over the next few years, we’ll see massive innovations that will reshape how brands create, personalize, and distribute video content. Here are the key trends to watch. 1. Hyper-Personalized AI-Generated Video Content Personalization has already changed digital marketing, but AI is taking it to a new level—automating personalized video creation at scale. Imagine sending thousands of unique video messages customized for individual viewers based on their preferences, behaviors, or past interactions. Brands are already using AI to: Translate and localize content in a click to scale it to global audiences Generate personalized product recommendation videos based on browsing history. Customize video in real time, tailoring messaging based on a user’s location, industry, or interests. Send individualized customer onboarding videos, making automated outreach feel personal and human. 2. Interactive AI-Generated Video Experiences The next frontier in AI-powered video is interactivity. Instead of passive viewing, AI will enable brands to create videos that adapt in real-time based on user interaction. Future AI-generated videos will allow users to: Scale content production with the use of AI avatars, focusing more time on impactful scripts and less time on giving filming directions Choose their own storylines, dynamically adjusting content based on clicks. Interact with AI-powered virtual assistants embedded in video content. Provide feedback through real-time surveys, altering the next scene or message. This shift will make video marketing far more engaging and user-driven, enhancing the way brands communicate with their audiences. 3. AI for Live Video Production & Real-Time Optimization AI isn’t just transforming pre-recorded videos—it’s also enhancing live video production in ways we never imagined. In the near future, AI will: Auto-enhance video quality during live streams, adjusting lighting, color, and resolution in real time. Provide instant multi-language translation, allowing global audiences to engage with live content. Optimize content delivery, dynamically adjusting video elements based on real-time audience reactions. 4. AI-Generated Scriptwriting and Storyboarding Becomes Standard As AI advances, scriptwriting and video ideation will become faster and more intuitive. Soon, marketers will be able to: Input a blog post or rough idea, and AI will generate a full-length video script with suggested visual elements. Use AI-powered storyboarding tools to automatically map out shot sequences. Generate fully AI-directed explainer videos that adapt content dynamically based on audience behavior. The Future is AI-Powered—Are You Ready? AI is set to redefine video marketing in ways that will make content more personalized, engaging, and scalable than ever before. Brands that embrace these innovations now will stay ahead of the curve—producing more videos, faster, with less effort and greater impact.

Things are about to get easier with invideo AI by your side (even if you’re an absolute beginner). Forget the hefty investment in cameras and gear. With invideo AI, all you need to do is “imagine” what kind of video you want to produce and give a prompt based on that (e.g. create a video on “5 productivity tips and use American male accent”, and voilà – it’ll transform your ideas into stunning videos within minutes! So whether you're a budding entrepreneur, a content creator, or a marketer aiming to build your online presence, invideo AI will be your go-to tool. Best For: Pretty much everything! With invideo AI you can make professional-quality videos for YouTube channel, Instagram reels, TikTok, and other purposes such as social media posts, marketing campaigns, and product demos.

This helps you easily search and put the right video clips into any part of your video. If you need a specific picture or multiple photos, it quickly looks through this big collection pile and picks the best ones. This makes sure your video looks good and matches the requirements. 2. Text Prompt Video Editing This tool makes video editing easier by letting you fix things with easy words or phrases. It's like telling a human video editor what to do, but it's even easier with a tool. Need to remove a scene, use different stock footage, or change the accent? Just give a prompt, and the AI will do the rest. This makes editing easier, even if you don't know much about editing. 3. AI-Powered Script Generation Invideo's AI script maker helps you make interesting, custom scripts for any video project, which saves you a lot of time in writing scripts. This tool is especially useful for platforms like YouTube, where your content needs to be intriguing enough to engage people & grow your channel. 4. Affordable Voiceover Alternatives The AI voiceover generator is a cheaper option than paying for professional voice actors. It makes a speech that sounds like a human in multiple accents, understanding the feeling, intent, and emotion behind each word. This function makes your videos feel alive, adding a professional look without costing too much. Pros It quickly changes your words into videos, making creating content more manageable. You can spend more time on your work and less on technical stuff. With more than 16 million stock media choices, you have access to a unique selection of pictures. This is perfect if you want to create top-notch quality videos without investing hours in creating them. AI-powered script generation can save you a lot of time in making regular, good-quality video content. It's especially helpful if you often face writer's block or have tight schedules. The AI voiceover generator tool can save money while still giving a good sound experience. This is really helpful if you own a small business or are an individual creator. Cons Initially, you might need some time to learn how to interact with the AI well to get the results you want. However, as you proceed, this eventually gets easier as the interface itself is pretty user-friendly. The free version includes watermarks. But, this is a small worry because the paid version starts at just $25/month and gives you a ton of premium features. Pricing Basic: Free Plus: $25/month Max: $60/month (The yearly plans start as low as $20/month) Sign up for invideo AI and start creating high-quality videos within minutes. Try online AI video maker Create high-quality videos for your business with AI video maker easily Get Started Now 2. Descript Do you need help with problems like evoking human facial expressions and emotional responses or the technical bottlenecks that make the video generation process time-consuming? If yes, Descript can help your creative workflow and enrich the quality of your output, making it more high-end and appealing. Moreover, it also realizes the significance of the human side of video production as it's not designed to replace human creativity but to make it better, to give you a vision, and to let the AI do the heavy lifting. Best For: As such, it's best suited to content creators, podcasters, and filmmakers who need to save time and get things done the right way. Because it is a text-based editing system, even the not-so-tech-savvy can use it. Top Features: 1. Automated Transcription Manually transcribing audio and video is time-consuming. To save time, Descript automatically transcribes all your recordings. Since the transcription is merely a text file, if you edit the transcription content, you can also edit the audio or video file itself. 2. Overdub Voice Cloning With Descript's Overdub function, you can type in the missing or correct text and then artificially generate the new audio in your voice or that of the guest. Creating a voice clone of this type involves using a voice sample to make the process convenient and smooth. 3. Studio Sound Editing Poor audio quality can negatively impact great content. Descript tackles this problem with its Studio Sound feature, which applies state-of-the-art AI to enhance the sound quality of audio files. It eliminates noise, hum, and distortion, giving a cleaner and more professional studio-type sound. 4. Video Green Screen and AI Eye Contact The green screen background editor lets you change the environment behind the video, just like a Zoom feature, so you can have more control over how you present your content. This facilitates the humanizing of the video and adds to its realism. Pros It offers a fantastic transcription tool that can automatically transcribe audio and video files into text in 23 languages. It's a handy platform that lets you cut, rearrange, or alter the contents and simplifies editing. It improves the recorded audio quality by making the spoken words much clearer. This makes your content sound super-smooth without you having to edit out one word at a time. Descript also integrates with other platforms such as Slack (a team communication tool), Podbean (podcast hosting platform), Restream (a LIVE streaming studio), and even Final Cut Pro (a professional video editing application), to name a few. You also get tutorials on using the platform to help you quickly master the features and make the most of it. Cons The learning curve for Descript isn't very gentle for someone used to text-based editing. At first, this may seem patchy, but it is difficult for users of conventional timeline-based editing tools to work. Descript boasts a full range of powerful tools but may not meet the requirements of professional-level video editing. It doesn’t even provide the convenient access to advanced effects and controls that a professional editing package would provide. Pricing is a per-person, per-month fee. This can be costly for teams or organizations with many people, primarily if more than one person uses the software. Pricing Free Tier Creator Tier: $15 per user per month Pro Tier: $30 per user per month Enterprise Tier: Custom 3.

The platform allows you to apply the style of any one image or prompt to every frame of your video.

By inputting an image or prompt, Runway ML can increase the realness of untextured renders. This is useful in creating realistic-looking images. Cons You might require a lot of computing resources and time. More complex tasks or high resolutions result in higher resource costs, and this may restrict its availability to users with less powerful hardware.

This library saves you from the trouble of searching for the right file everywhere by making it easier to track down materials from various places. Cost-wise, the tool is quite economical. You can even get better results with it than hiring professionals to do voice-over work. This reasonably priced special feature makes it ideal for any creators with limited amounts of money but ample amounts of content. Cons It does not offer great variety in pictorial variations. Though many options are there, these still might need to fit exactly your creative vision. You might experience glitches and bugs. These technical fumblings can be a bit of a roadblock to your work but are often just remediable with updates or support services. It provides a limited number of minutes per month at no charge. But that's a limit if you are doing really large projects or creating lots of output. Perhaps you would have to limit yourself and decide when to use it or spend extra for a paid plan.

Visla Looking for the best AI video generator from text? Visla can be your right choice for a storytelling tool powered by AI that makes the entire process simpler. It has been fashioned as an easily accessible and powerful platform for a wide variety of users engaged in marketing, education, and other activities. Its most noteworthy feature is the ability to promote collaboration and improve workflow efficiency to quickly turn your ideas into videos. This lets you use storytelling and communication techniques with greater precision and effectiveness! Best For: Visla is the perfect option for developing and producing videos for marketing and sales, engineering, content creation, social media, team communications, customer service, and even personal branding. This is precisely what makes it so useful for professionals and teams to develop their own strategies for using storytelling to interact with audiences. Top Features: 1. Collaboration and Feedback Visla makes it simple to share your videos with your team or readers. In other words, you can use videos with other people, and you can receive others’ feedback. 2. Versatility for Various Industries Whether you work in marketing, sales, teaching, entertainment, or some other field, it's made to fit in wherever people work. 3. Diverse Use Cases Visla is just good for a variety of these video activities. You can create videos for social media, record personal messages to customers, recap meetings, convert old videos into new uses, or shoot videos for teaching and learning. It's like having one tool to deal with just about any job! 4. AI Summary Visla provides a feature that allows the main points of a text to be immediately grasped. Using AI, it discovers the key points, such as the keywords or main topics, or otherwise makes a long transcript short. 5. Teleprompter Mode Afraid you might have forgotten something or won't do a good job of expressing what is on your mind? This is where the teleprompter mode helps by letting you read from your marks instead of into the lens. This makes you look more confident and you don't lose your audience as you can make eye contact. 6. Community Hub Within the community hub, you can participate in discussions, seek advice, exchange experiences, and even receive ideas from other users. It's a place where you can get to know people using Visla too, help, and learn from one another. Pros Visla gives users the ability to create high-quality videos, working from the most minimal of ideas, perhaps even just a script. The platform can also be used to cover such tasks as writing scripts, narrating in its own voice, choosing the right pieces of video to show, and so on. Its AI-assisted editing functionality can even remove unwanted portions of video with an automatic effect. It has a comprehensible, easy interface, despite its many functions, which means that it can be used by people at every skill level. It allows a first-time user to become proficient with it only really requiring a timer, so that after only 2-3 minutes one can become accustomed. Visla's free subscription plan is particularly generous, as it allows publishers up to 50 minutes of video free of charge every month. This time is longer than most. Of course, there is also a great deal of access to the free version, which offers many of the platform’s main functions. It also comes with all the tools to aid in video production. With narration-assistance features powered by AI, screen recording functions for demonstration videos, text overlays for social media interviews, and so much more. Cons The inability to generate images is one major shortcoming of Visla compared to tools using coherent AI. To make up for this shortcoming, users who want to add this functionality have to feed suitable images to an external AI image generator before importing them into Visla. Exporting videos before downloading them can be very time-consuming. Likewise, the download speeds are quite slow. Even when Visla generates videos itself, it doesn't happen instantaneously, and it can still take a couple of minutes. The computer-generated script might contain mistakes that must be checked and corrected by a human. In addition, since the AI voiceover sometimes pronounces words incorrectly, this might affect the quality of the narrative. Pricing Basic: Free Plan Premium: $24 per month 6. Opus Clip Opus Clip converts full-length videos into short viral videos, and it shines through its comprehensive video content analysis capability. It also determines which parts are most effective and assembles them in easily digestible short clippings. It also employs cutting-edge artificial intelligence-enhanced functions such as AI Curation, AI Virality Score, and AI Emoji Generator to boost the attractiveness and virality of the content. All in all, it provides a great balance between accessibility and advanced, AI-assisted functionality, for newbies and experienced users too! Best For: Converting long-form video content into short clips that can go viral. It uses AI to help you create fun short videos with little effort. Top Features: 1. AI Curation This feature uses GPT-4 Turbo, the most advanced artificial intelligence, to take a long video and pick out the most intriguing segments. The selected parts are then crafted together into an attention-grabbing and compact short clip. Not only can it intelligently choose the segments, but it can also put this into a narrative framework, presenting the video in an organized, entertaining manner. 2. AI Virality Score Using AI and big data analysis of thousands of viral videos, Opus Clip attaches a score for its virality to each clip. With this score, you get a better idea of the potential impact of the cut, and you can use data to make decisions on the best way to maximize reach and engagement. 3. AI Co-Pilot With this feature, you have greater control over the video editing process. You can specify the time frames in your video to clip and make more focused and accurate content. 4. Active Speaker Detection Using predictive AI, Opus Clip analyzes and follows moving faces in the video. This enables you to keep your guests' (or, if you decide to take your own) face in the middle of the video frame. It makes your content more concentrated and professional-looking. 5. AI Keyword Highlighter With this tool, your video captions' important keywords are automatically selected and highlighted which can help to attain higher viewer engagement rates. 6. AI Emoji Generator The power of emojis is not lost on Opus Clip, which automatically adds suitable emojis to your video content. Pros It makes the video production process much faster. In other words, if a video project normally takes an hour, with Opus Clip it could be done in a few minutes. Part of the timesaving potential is especially useful for those who have to produce large amounts of video regularly. With the free trial, you can test the tool without risking any money. You can upload up to 120 minutes of video for free to test its features and determine whether or not it is right for you. This multi-language support makes the tool easier to use in different regions and audiences. This is particularly helpful for creators of content and content generators for whom English is their main language and they’re targeting an international audience or simply working in a multilingual environment. Its useful first paragraph-generating capabilities alone make it a game-changer when it comes to attracting viewers from the start. Cons Opus Clip may be a powerful software, but you would have to invest significant time and effort far beyond just learning how to use the product before you can master its full range of features. This learning curve could be an obstacle for those who need to quickly produce results without going into too much technical detail. Its effectiveness depends on the quality of the input video. If the original content was lousily shot or edited, it might not be able to finely tune it. While customization options are there, they may not meet all requirements or individual preferences of users. For some, this is a drawback, especially if highly personal or unique video styles are needed. The default caption may not be to everyone's tastes and could undermine creative expression. Pricing Free plan Starter Plan: $9 per month Pro: $ 19 per month 7. Colossyan Looking for the best AI music video generator? Colossyan can be just the right choice! It is an AI-assisted video creation tool for streamlining the video-creating process.

With a range of pricing plans available to suit various needs and budgets, Colossyan provides an economical solution for many users. Cons The actors are advanced AI-generated avatars, looking and sounding highly lifelike, but the platform is limited to these digital actors. This limitation does not allow users to directly incorporate live human actors or their own recordings into the platform. As comfortable and convenient as Colossyan is, the more sophisticated its customization capabilities are as they need a learning curve.

There are a range of flexible pricing plans, suited to your particular needs and budget.

This lets you experiment with different voices depending on what you're shooting. Cons If you choose the personal plan, the maximum video quality is limited to 720p. This may be a drawback if you are after a high-definition video. The platform's content moderation system is probably not 100% foolproof, so there is a possibility of inappropriate content slipping through the net. On Windows and Android, you may encounter problems when it comes to feature recognition. If you're using these platforms and want complete compatibility, then this could be a potential drawback.

Creative activity is no exception. What are the main advantages of generating videos with artificial intelligence? More information is provided in the following article. Author Kamila Rollerová More Advantages of AI in Video Creation The presence of an expert artist is still irreplaceable, but it is already proven that artificial intelligence can create remarkably high-quality and content-rich videos. What are the main advantages of AI image generation? Speed and Efficiency AI systems can process a large amount of video material relatively quickly and efficiently. Machine learning-based algorithms perform automatic processing, saving substantial time for human colleagues. This naturally leads to increased productivity and acceleration of the entire video creation process. Enhanced Quality Thanks to advanced algorithms, AI systems can automatically improve the quality of individual videos. They can remove unwanted noise, stabilize shaky footage, adjust inappropriate lighting and contrast, or make other enhancements that improve the overall visual quality of videos. Task Automation Another advantage of using AI for video creation may be the automation of certain routine tasks, such as automatic recognition and labeling of objects or the creation of subtitles and captions. This capability also saves considerable time for human colleagues. Ability to Generate Content The last major advantage of inviting artificial intelligence to generate videos is the fact that it can generate new content based on existing videos. For example, it can create videos with various stylizations, add special effects to them, or create new scenes based on specific instructions. Disadvantages of AI in Video Creation Every coin has two sides. Similarly, video creation with artificial intelligence also has its drawbacks. The main ones include the following two. Lack of Creativity and Originality AI can generate videos that are too similar to existing content, AI has a limited range of ideas and inspiration, absence of human intuition and creative thinking. Danger of Spreading Disinformation the possibility of misuse of generated videos to manipulate information and subsequently spread false news, AI can be used to create realistic deepfake videos, which can seriously damage the reputation of specific individuals. Caution and Cleverness As the ancient King Solomon aptly said, \"The naive believe every word, but the wise consider their steps.\" When using artificial intelligence, caution and cleverness are always desirable.

ChatGPT and similar generative AI chatbots are all the talk, but new advancements are particularly exciting when it comes to the use of AI in video production! From voiceover creation to analytics, generative artificial intelligence has the potential to streamline and enhance many aspects of the video production process! AI's impact on video production will grow even more significant as it continues to develop and evolve. However, like most good things, using AI in your video production process also has limitations. In particular, AI has shortcomings in areas that require a more insightful and creative approach. In this blog post, we'll explore the benefits and drawbacks of using AI in video production and discuss where it works best in the overall video production process. Revolutionizing Video Production: How AI Is Changing The Future Artificial Intelligence is likely the future of video production. The expanding use of AI models in video production has been revolutionizing video marketing and the whole video production industry. With AI technology, it's possible to streamline your workflow, improve accuracy, and reduce project turnaround times. Thanks to this powerful tool, your production team can spend more time focusing on creativity and innovation. This extra focus will help ensure unique and captivating videos. Here are some specific areas where AI is positively contributing to video production: SCRIPTWRITING Photographer: Super Snapper | Source: Unsplash Quality scriptwriting is a crucial component of a compelling video. A well-written script will engage and impress your viewers, while a poorly written one can lead to indifference and disengagement. Crafting a script that successfully communicates your message to the right audience allows your video to resonate with viewers and drive action. In recent years, AI has become a fantastic resource for scriptwriting. Using AI in video production can help writers generate new ideas, revise old scripts, craft engaging stories, and even write complex dialogue. AI-powered scriptwriting tools also gather real-time data to help you: Pinpoint your target audience Analyze data from social media, news articles, apps, and other content Identify trends and topics that are relevant and popular Evaluate feedback and provide suggestions for improvement But don't forget about the importance of the human touch! Your audience will quickly recognize a flat AI-generated script, so add some warmth and authenticity to round the edges. Once you have your AI video script, pass it on to a real-life copywriter: They can add some personality and re-write phrases that don't quite make sense. A talented (and human) copywriter can do things AI just can't like: interpret intention and context, make emotional connections, and understand the subtlety and complexity of verbal and non-verbal language. VOICEOVERS A top-notch voiceover for your video creates a polished and professional final product. The voice must have an appropriate tone and style to match the intended message and audience. Scripts and voices should be carefully timed to the video. Producing a well-crafted voiceover ensures an engaging video with which your viewers can connect. Fortunately, AI in video production can quickly and easily create high-quality video voiceovers. Your businesses can save time and resources in the voice-over production process by using AI-powered text-to-speech (TTS) software, machine learning algorithms, and natural language processing (NLP). These tools also help create greater consistency and accuracy in the final product. Utilizing an AI-generated voice-over can do the following: Generate complete voiceovers in a matter of minutes (human voice recordings can take days or weeks) Customize various voices and accents to match any style of video content Adjust parameters such as pitch, volume, and speed to align perfectly with the video Maintain a natural tone, consistent pace, and accurate pronunciation throughout Artificial Intelligence can drastically improve your voiceover's overall quality and professionalism, leading to increased viewer engagement and retention. Just know that while it is an incredibly useful tool, AI isn't perfect. It can't understand flow or intention. Unlike live actors, it lacks the ability to make changes based on interpretation. And sometimes, the voice can sound a little like… well, like a robot imitating a human. TRANSCRIPTS AND SUBTITLES Producing high-quality video transcripts and subtitles ensures your content reaches the widest possible audience. In particular, you'll include viewers with hearing issues, language barriers, and those watching silently. Additionally, you can use this text to put your video content in written formats like blog posts and websites. It's essential, however, to maintain accuracy and clarity because errors can lead to confusion and misinterpretation of your message. AI in video production is a highly efficient way to auto-generate transcripts and subtitles for your videos. A few platforms have actually been using AI systems to transcribe for quite some time. You can accurately transcribe video content and quickly generate subtitles by leveraging deep learning AI algorithms and language processing technology like NLP. AI-powered transcription and captioning services have several significant benefits: Transcribes content in only a few short minutes, saving countless hours Edit and customize AI-generated transcripts and subtitles to quickly meet specific audience needs Improve your video's search engine optimization (SEO) by giving search engines text to crawl and index almost instantly Recognize speech patterns and capture the nuances of language in a once impossible way Keep in mind that you'll still need a sound crew to capture audio elements that AI tools likely won't pick up. For example, AI can't transcribe audio elements that aren't voices, such as sound effects and music. And regarding accuracy, though AI is constantly improving, it's always wise to have a human being review your written content for any mistakes or misspellings. ANALYTICS Photographer: Carlos Muza | Source: Unsplash Analytics tools can provide valuable insights into how viewers engage with video content, including metrics such as view count, engagement rate, and audience retention. By analyzing these metrics, businesses can better understand what video elements are resonating with viewers and what may need to be adjusted. Your content will go further if you use analytics to guide your future video production and marketing strategies.

As you can see, AI in video production has the potential to become the ultimate tool in streamlining the video production process_._ But let's be honest; AI isn't a one-size-fits-all solution. AI falls short in some areas, especially those requiring a more nuanced and creative approach. The Limitations Of AI In Video Production: Why Human Input Still Matters Using AI automation for the tedious parts of video production, like transcribing, subtitling, and analytic tasks, frees up time and money for human video editors to focus on more creative and strategic aspects of video production. That's a good thing because AI can't compete with people when it comes to creating concepts and relaying emotions, storyboarding, and even serious editing. Let's look at a few more areas where AI hasn't quite caught up (yet). CREATIVE CONCEPTS While artificial Intelligence is a powerhouse for many aspects of video production, it currently lacks in the creative concept department. This is because the creative process of developing video content usually involves subjective, complex decisions that require human input and creativity. AI \"brains\" are a filing cabinet of existing facts and data that can be combined for helpful solutions and sometimes \"new to us\" ideas. Consequently, AI cannot replicate creative vision or intuition. AI can generate visual and audio elements based on predefined parameters. Still, it cannot replace the unique ideas and perspectives that come from human creativity and imagination. Furthermore, the creative conception of videos often involves collaboration and communication between different team members, including writers, designers, and directors. While using AI in video production can streamline certain aspects of this process, such as analyzing feedback data, it cannot replace the value of human collaboration and brainstorming. As a result, AI simply can't help much with the creative conception of videos. Thankfully, the artistic process will continue to rely on human creativity, intuition, and collaboration to develop unique and engaging video content that resonates with audiences. STORYBOARDING Humans may not always have the upper hand on AI, but regarding storyboarding, we definitely have them beat. That's because the storyboarding process involves creativity and intuition, and a profound comprehension of human emotion and motivation. Storyboarding involves visualizing and planning the narrative arc of a video, including the characters, scenes, and dialogue. This requires a deep understanding of the target audience, their preferences, and their emotional responses. While AI can generate insights and analyze data about audience behavior, it cannot replicate the emotional intellect that a human storyboard artist can bring to the table. Moreover, storyboarding often requires making creative decisions based on reasoning and personal perspective. A human storyboard artist can draw on their own experiences and imagination to develop unique and engaging visual elements that capture the essence of your story. AI in video production, on the other hand, can only generate visuals based on data sets, which limits the originality of the final product. Lastly, this process is often collaborative and involves lots of communication and cooperation. A storyboard artist can effectively express their feelings to other team members, developing a cohesive and compelling narrative. At the same time, AI in video production still lacks the ability to engage in thoughtful compromise. EDITING Editing videos involves piecing together the footage, adding music, sound effects, and transitions, and making cuts and adjustments to ensure the final product is exactly as it was envisioned. Good editing can make all the difference in the completed video, as it helps create a more cohesive and engaging narrative and can also enhance the visual and auditory aspects of the video. AI in video production and editing has come a long way. Newer AI capabilities, like quickly and seamlessly merging multiple clips, have eliminated countless hours of human editing and undoubtedly saved many budgets. And while AI is great at tackling basic tasks like motion tracking, color correction, and other technical processes, it has yet to advance enough to replace human editing completely. Skilled editors have a keen eye for detail and understand how to use their tools to create a visually and thematically impactful video that resonates with the target audience. Humans have an innate understanding of the storytelling process and the ability to interpret other people's intentions, like writers and directors. This helps them grasp the overall vision for the video, which is still a relatively abstract concept for Artificial Intelligence. AI in video production has made significant advancements in recent years. However, despite its potential, one of its most significant limitations is its reliance on pre-existing data sets or algorithms. AI only learns and operates within the parameters set by its programming and training data. This can result in videos that feel unoriginal, repetitive, and lacking in personality and human touch, which may not resonate well with the target audience. The Rise Of AI In Video Production: A Game-Changer AI is changing the video production and marketing game, whether we like it or not. Currently, there are many effective ways to use AI in video production. From automating tedious tasks to gaining valuable insights and improving efficiency in the video production process, it has become a great way to save time and money. But with all its benefits, AI simply can not replace the unique human touch and creativity needed to make truly memorable and compelling videos. While AI can handle repetitive tasks like data analysis, basic production, and editing, it needs to catch up in areas that require a more subjective and creative approach. But by leveraging the strengths of AI technology and human creativity together, it’s possible to create innovative and impactful videos more efficiently.

From the initial stages to final tweaks, explore the latest AI technologies and what they do for better filmmaking. Victoria Greywing 15 January, 2025 - 5 min read Production Technologies Artificial intelligence always finds new ways to amaze film and content makers. New technologies appear, workflows change, and people get more (and easier) options to use their creative minds. AI goes big, whether it’s a draft-making process or the editing. We know that it will drive the production forward… but how far can it go? What AI does for today’s video production, and how will it shape the future? Delve into the article to find out! 🤖 Current State of AI in Video Production From now on, it's safe to say that AI isn't just a concept or a buzzword that people throw around to sound smart or trendy. The technology has diverse applications across different parts of filmmaking. We have AI for visual effects, automated clipping, smart video creation… the list can keep going. AI in video editing software can organize clips, detect scene changes, or even recommend next techniques based on the cut you already have. Furthermore, thanks to machine learning in video creation, filmmakers can now produce inspiring stories without extra work. It would take a human editor hours, if not days, to create something like a movie trailer or a music video. For businesses and other organizations, it signifies cost savings. This is what automation in video production brings to the table: speed, efficiency, and quality. No need to do everything by yourself—let AI cover your back. But what's next? 🎬 AI in Pre-Production and Planning If you think video production only applies to editing, think again. The tech isn't just for the final curtain call! Algorithms can evaluate the draft’s direction, foster video ideas, suggest plot improvements, and create shot lists. Those provide a solid foundation for writers to build upon and help people with writer's block to overcome their creative slump. Its appliance in video content don’t stop on that. Storyboards are another area. This technology allows filmmakers to visualize their projects more accurately and apply needed alterations before actual shooting begins. Artificial intelligence can also optimize shooting schedules, predict potential delays, and manage resources effectively. It combines various factors (weather conditions, availability of actors, location constraints) to build the best schedule possible. At this stage, AI in filmmaking helps make the production run smoothly, minimizing the risk of costly delays/reshoots. 🌟 Many tools have emerged to bring the benefits of AI into pre-production, and one such platform is Filmustage. It simplifies and enhances the entire planning process by analyzing scripts to identify elements like locations, props, and characters, providing a comprehensive breakdown in minutes. Its scheduling capabilities consider real-world constraints, such as weather or actor availability, to build efficient plans. Additionally, budgeting features allow filmmakers to allocate resources effectively and stay on track financially. Are you ready to take your filmmaking to the next level? With Filmustage, you can streamline your pre-production process like never before. Free Sign Up With AI as a trusted partner in pre-production, filmmakers can focus on what truly matters: telling inspiring stories that captivate audiences. 🎥 AI in Filmmaking and On-Set Production AI for content creators has progressed to such an extent that it can now generate synthetic footage mostly indistinguishable from the real one. On set, filmmakers have automated camera systems, AI for visual effects, facial recognition technology, and more of that. AI-powered video tools can help directors, cinematographers, and other crew members make critical decisions quickly. AI cameras can monitor various aspects of the shoot, like lighting conditions, camera angles, and actor performances, providing real-time feedback to improve the video quality. These advancements improve efficiency and allow for more creative freedom on set. Creators can experiment with different techniques and effects, knowing that AI video editing tools will assist in achieving the desired results. 🎞️ Enhancements with AI in Post-Production This phase gets a huge boost from AI, especially in editing and sound design. The automation offers advanced editing capabilities, such as color balance presets, automated scene detection, motion tracking, intelligent cutting, etc. Smart video editing apps can identify key moments, streamline workflows, and enhance the narrative. AI also excels in sound editing, with features easing the isolation and audio enhancement, background noise removal, and soundtrack sync. Regarding color correction, even some free video editing software can automatically refine the color settings and apply complex grading techniques to create consistent looks. Furthermore, AI can repurpose your videos to make various versions of a film for different platforms, such as social media and TV. Need a YouTube Short? There you have it in a click of a button. AI optimizes what you have for the best possible viewing experience. These advances in AI for the film industry mean that filmmakers can create top-quality content swiftly and with precision. 🤔 Future Prospects and Ethical Considerations Looking ahead, the future of video editing and filmmaking holds immense potential. Next developments may include more advanced AI-enhanced filmmaking techniques or AI handling the entire process, from start to finish, without any human involvement. And that’s the concern for many people, as AI’s growing capabilities bring up ethical considerations. Will these technologies replace human jobs? How will the impact of AI in filmmaking affect creativity and originality? Data privacy and algorithm bias are other areas to consider. As AI algorithms are trained with existing data, any underlying biases can be amplified in their decision-making processes, resulting in misrepresentation or discrimination. The future of AI in video production needs thoughtful deliberation and adherence to ethical standards to ensure it is used responsibly and beneficially. And you can only achieve it through open discussion, collaboration, and ongoing monitoring of these systems. Conclusion Artificial intelligence definitely marks a big step forward in how video production is evolving. Bringing AI tools and filmmaking together makes everything more efficient, creative, and accessible. While there are valid concerns about what AI can do with jobs and ethics, there is no doubt that this technology has much to offer. Through responsible usage and continued development, AI is set to modify the film industry and open the path for new creative adventures. It's important to stay updated with the latest advances in AI for the film industry. So, keep an eye out for future movies, product announcements, or just social media posts to see how AI is shaping the video production industry.

Sign Up Now The Ultimate Guide to AI-Powered Video: What It Is and How to Best Use It By Vyond Team on April 26, 2023 AI is changing the way companies create video content. Find out which categories of AI-powered tools can help you create videos faster, the pros and cons of each, and the many ways using this technology can help you meet your business goals. Table of contents What is AI powered video? Examples of AI video maker tools Generative AI video tools: the pros and cons The business benefits of using generative AI The future of AI video maker tools What is AI powered video? While smartphones, webcams, and simple video editor apps have made it incredibly easy in the past few decades to create simple video content for personal use, creating professional-grade videos at scale has remained, for many companies, a serious logistical challenge. Fortunately, that’s about to change. With the arrival of powerful new generative AI technology—including advanced AI chatbots, text-to-image and text-to-video generators, AI avatar makers, and AI-powered animated video creation software, content creators have more tools at their disposal than ever before to help them create business videos quickly and affordably. There’s a difference between what AI tools and humans can create, of course. Generative AI models are able to mine the gigantic datasets they’re trained on to create content that reproduces linguistic and visual styles that people have spent centuries perfecting. However, AI text generators are still unable to come up with original ideas, reason through difficult puzzles, and often serve up answers that are categorically false. And image and video generators often struggle to translate text-based prompts into content that both reflects the requester’s intentions and is of a high enough quality to use as is. Still—even in its infancy, Generative AI tools are already making it much easier for professionals with limited video production experience to create professional videos. You don’t need years of design, directing, and editing experience to get started: all you need is an idea…and a prompt. Examples of AI video maker tools From text-to-audio synthesizers to video generators that transform visuals from one style to another, there’s a huge range of AI tools out there. Here is a quick breakdown of the types of tools that today’s content creators can take advantage of. Text tools for creating AI videos To create an engaging video, first you need a great script. Text-based AI tools like ChatGPT and Bard are advanced LLMs (Large Language Models) that can quickly generate scripts based on text prompts you provide. The prompt is processed by the AI’s deep learning algorithm which formulates a response for the user based on the Internet-sourced data set it’s been trained on–-or based on proprietary information the user feeds it. As an AI video tool, ChatGPT can help with research, creating a script’s structure, writing on-screen captions, and even suggestions for visuals (though that’s not one of its strengths–yet). Whatever tool you use, it’s now possible to generate a script in a fraction of the time it used to. Watch “Write Better Video Scripts Faster with ChatGPT” On-Demand Image tools for creating AI videos Video creators can use AI-generated static images to quickly create storyboards, or even use the elements directly in their final videos. AI image generators like Dall.E 2, or Stable Diffusion Online and MidJourney draw on the internet’s rich source of photos, illustrations, and graphics to produce new imagery in response to a user’s prompt. Dall.E 2 also allows you to fill out or extend the area around your preferred image (outpainting) and fill in missing or incomplete areas by evaluating the existing imagery and formulating content that matches the content and style (inpainting). While this feature isn’t offered within MidJourney and Stable Diffusion Online as of mid-April 2023, you can import images created on those platforms into Dall.E 2 and manipulate them there. Also, both Dall.E 2 and Midjourney now allow you to upload your own images and include them as a reference in your prompt. This allows you to also ask for variations of existing, preferred reference images, instead of having to only work with outputs created based on text prompts. Audio tools for creating AI videos Need a voiceover but don’t have the budget to hire voice talent and book a recording studio? Some AI tools can step in to generate a realistic sounding voiceover in a variety of languages by collecting text input and delivering a synthesized audio stream in a process known as “text-to-speech.” Other AI tools can remove background noise from recordings, or even create background music from scratch. Simply choose the genre, mood, length and tempo for a video with a unique, royalty-free soundtrack. AI video generation software Some AI video tools apply a similar approach to those for text, image and audio, taking either text or visual input and generating an output of original video content. Meta’s Make-a-Video creates video from both text-based prompts and static images. Phenaki uses proprietary technology to create longer videos when given a sequence of textual prompts. Other AI-powered tools offer the ability to use human-like avatars to deliver scripts directly to the camera. While these tools allow you to generate content at volume, it’s worth noting that most deepfake human avatars suffer from the ‘uncanny valley’ effect: people register that what they’re seeing and hearing is close to, but not quite human, which can be off-putting.) Lastly, AI-powered animated video software platforms like Vyond provide a more holistic solution, using multiple AI-driven features (like Photo-to-Character avatars, Text-to-Speech generator, Visual Search for assets, and Speech Enhancer) to help teams quickly create engaging, professional-looking animated videos that never suffer from the “uncanny valley effect,” since most animation isn’t meant to look photorealistic. Try Vyond for Free Generative AI video tools: the pros and cons AI powered video tools are revolutionizing the workplace but they aren’t without their faults. Here are some of the benefits and limitations of AI tools used to create text, video, images and audio. “It’s inspiring that AI is making its way to all corners of society, with many applications large and small.”Andrew Ng, Founder and CEO of Landing AI While there’s no doubt AI is going to transform the economy, it still has limits and specific use cases. It can’t do everything. And it may not always be the right tool for a business.”Marketing AI Institute Benefits of AI-powered text tools Helps you brainstorm ideas. When you’re staring at a page with no idea where to start, an AI chatbot can be a lifesaver. While these won’t produce the final copy, they’re great at providing you with a first draft to play around with. Saves serious time. Writing good copy takes time, and with research, writing, and editing, that time quickly adds up. With an AI text generation tool, simply enter a prompt and you’ll have output to start editing and developing in seconds. Can imitate a wide range of styles. In your text prompt, you can add direction on style and tone and include proprietary copy you’d like it to learn from and imitate. This capability can help you with creating “on-brand” content, and can help spark ideas for new ways to solve creative problems. Limitations of AI-powered text tools ChatGPT is only trained on information found on the Internet prior to October 2021. As a result, its responses don’t reflect the most up-to-date information on topics, especially those that evolve quickly. This is another reason to always review its output before you hit publish. They don’t understand your audience like you do. AI will never be able to understand your audiences’ needs and preferences the way you do – what makes them tick, or pushes their buttons. This is another reason it’s so important to review and adjust their output. For more information, check out our guide on how to use ChatGPT to create business video scripts. ChatGPT Prompts for Business Videos Benefits of AI-powered audio tools Generates narration quickly and affordably. There’s no need to hire a voice actor, source expensive equipment, or book recording time. With a high-quality AI-powered audio tool you can generate realistic audio with a quick turnaround. Many include instant translation features. Sending copy to translators before you can get your video to a global audience is now a thing of the past as AI tools can instantly translate audio in a huge selection of languages and dialects. “You can’t have somebody producing a new audio version of one article every time it’s updated. But with […] synthetic language, there’s hardly any additional cost to production at all.”Andy Webb, head of product for the voice and artificial intelligence team at the BBC Limitations of AI-powered audio tools Some AI-generated narration sounds…off. Emotions can be hard for an AI audio tool to replicate. While output is constantly improving, humans generally still possess more range. Accent choices are often limited. Many AI audio tools can’t offer you as many accents and dialects (spoken by people of various genders and ages) as you might like. Vyond’s AI audio capabilitiesVyond’s text-to-speech AI feature provides 600 AI voice options across 71 languages, in male and female varieties–and, as of May 2023—allows you to adjust the audio track so it reflects the emotion you want conveyed. Vyond’s Instant Translation features also allow you to instantly and automatically translate all the text in your videos, including scene text, dialog text entered for text-to-speech, and recordings, into every one of those languages. Try Vyond for Free Benefits of AI-powered image and video tools Anyone can be a creator. Whether you’re a professional designer or someone who can’t draw a stick figure, you’ll be able to generate useful images and video content quickly. Inspires fresh ideas. When you’re struggling to visualize an idea, AI image generators can provide options that help you clarify what you want. Easy to replicate visual styles. From Van Gogh to Andy Warhol to [fill in your favorite artist here]—with a simple prompt (containing either text or a combination of text and image references) you can imitate an incredibly diverse set of styles Limitations of AI-powered image and video tools Their output doesn’t always hit the mark. When the visual delivered to you doesn’t match what you were imagining in your mind’s eye, you have the option to keep prompting for other alternatives. And if you’re using Dall.E 2–you can try adjusting its output with its inpainting or outpainting tools. Even so, these efforts may not give you exactly what you wanted. They’re not reliable for creating “on-brand” visuals. For the reasons above, you’re likely not going to be able to lean on these tools to create visual content that perfectly aligns with your company’s brand style—yet. There are ethical concerns around copyright. While an artist’s work may be accessed freely on the internet, it’s unlikely they gave permission for their art to be used in the AI’s learning model. Currently, in the US, AI-generated work isn’t copyright protected because it isn’t technically made by a human. The business benefits of using generative AI Companies of all kinds can reap the benefits of using an AI tool to create professional videos. Here are a few of the most common: Support your company’s employee retention goals The simplicity and time efficiency of AI video helps L&D professionals keep up with industry changes and internal demands for new or updated training materials for their entire workforce. This is especially valuable because timely, effective training is proven to have extremely positive effects on retention. According to a LinkedIn study, 94% of employees say that they would stay at a company longer if it invested in better training. Create mission-critical content more quickly While we know that L&D teams regularly create videos to engage their workforce, they aren’t the only department that can benefit from the speed of AI-powered video tools. HR teams can use AI-powered video tools to ensure they’re communicating effectively about policies or business changes in a timely manner Sales departments can use generative AI video tools to keep up with the demand for creating highly personalized, tailored versions of general sales video content to share with prospects. (As we know from both academic and industry research, personalized strategies are more effective.) The speed of AI-powered video tools can help marketing teams keep up with the demand for engagement-boosting video content for blog and social media posts–and respond instantaneously to urgent news or trends with right-time, right-place video content. Additionally, the time saved in creating videos from scratch also frees up marketing teams to spend more time A/B testing their video content and making tweaks to boost engagement. Empower all your employees to communicate better (and have fun doing it) AI-powered video tools are becoming so easy to use, even employees with no writing and design capabilities now have a way to create engaging video content quickly. Not surprisingly, when creating videos is easy, it’s also more fun. In fact, many of our customers have said that using Vyond has made creating videos one of the most enjoyable parts of their job, instead of a time-consuming and intimidating chore.
